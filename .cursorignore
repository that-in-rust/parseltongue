# Ignore everything by default

# But allow Rust source files
!.rs

# Allow TOML configuration files
!.toml

# Allow plain text files
!.txt

# Ensure the directory structures are also allowed (so that files inside them can be accessed)
!src/
!tests/
!examples/

# If you have other directories that need to be included


# Optionally, allow your Cargo.toml and other essential files in the root
