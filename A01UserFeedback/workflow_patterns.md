# Parseltongue Workflow Patterns for Code Analysis

## Overview

This document provides three proven workflow patterns for common code analysis scenarios, developed through systematic testing on the Iggy message streaming system. Each workflow is designed to be practical, efficient, and repeatable.

## Workflow 1: "New to Codebase" - Understanding Architecture

### When to Use
- First time exploring a new codebase
- Need to understand overall system architecture
- Want to identify key components and patterns
- Preparing for code contributions

### Prerequisites
- Code dump already ingested with `parseltongue ingest`
- Basic understanding of the domain (e.g., message streaming, web framework, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Phase 1: Discover Architectural Patterns (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Find the main trait implementations to understand design patterns
parseltongue query what-implements Handler
parseltongue query what-implements Client  
parseltongue query what-implements Server
parseltongue query what-implements Service

# 2. Look for domain-specific patterns (adjust for your domain)
# For message streaming systems:
parseltongue query what-implements Source
parseltongue query what-implements Sink
parseltongue query what-implements Consumer

# For web frameworks:
parseltongue query what-implements Router
parseltongue query what-implements Middleware
parseltongue query what-implements Controller
```

**Expected Outcome**: Understanding of the main architectural patterns and how many implementations exist.

#### Phase 2: Identify Core Components (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# 3. Find the most-used types to identify central components
parseltongue query uses Client
parseltongue query uses Server
parseltongue query uses Config
parseltongue query uses Error

# 4. Look for domain-specific core types
# For message streaming:
parseltongue query uses Stream
parseltongue query uses Message
parseltongue query uses Topic

# For web frameworks:
parseltongue query uses Request
parseltongue query uses Response
parseltongue query uses Route
```

**Expected Outcome**: List of central components and their usage patterns throughout the codebase.

#### Phase 3: Generate Visual Overview (2-5 minutes)
```bash
# 5. Create interactive visualization for exploration
parseltongue visualize

# 6. Generate LLM context for key components (optional)
parseltongue generate-context MainClient
parseltongue generate-context CoreServer
```

**Expected Outcome**: Interactive HTML visualization and AI-friendly context for deeper exploration.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Identified 3-5 main architectural patterns
- [ ] Found 5-10 core components and their relationships
- [ ] Generated visual overview for reference
- [ ] Can explain the system's main purpose and structure

### Time Investment: 15-25 minutes
### Confidence Level After: 70-80% architectural understanding

## Workflow 2: "Impact Analysis Before Changes" - Risk Assessment

### When to Use
- Planning to modify existing code
- Need to understand change impact radius
- Preparing for refactoring
- Reviewing pull requests

### Prerequisites
- Code dump already ingested
- Specific component/function identified for modification
- Understanding of change scope (struct, function, trait, etc.)

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Phase 1: Direct Impact Assessment (2-5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. For struct/type changes - find all usage points
parseltongue query uses [YourStructName]
parseltongue query uses [YourTypeName]

# 2. For function changes - find all callers
parseltongue query calls [your_function_name]

# 3. For trait changes - find all implementations
parseltongue query what-implements [YourTrait]
```

**Expected Outcome**: Complete list of direct dependencies that will be affected.

#### Phase 2: Indirect Impact Assessment (3-7 minutes)
```bash
# 4. For each major component found in Phase 1, check its usage
# Example: if MessageHandler uses your component
parseltongue query uses MessageHandler
parseltongue query calls handle_message

# 5. Look for test coverage impact
parseltongue query uses [YourComponent] | grep -i test
parseltongue query calls [your_function] | grep -i test
```

**Expected Outcome**: Understanding of secondary effects and test coverage.

#### Phase 3: Risk Categorization (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# 6. Check for critical system components
parseltongue query uses [YourComponent] | grep -E "(main|server|client|core)"

# 7. Look for public API impact
parseltongue query uses [YourComponent] | grep -E "(pub|public|api|interface)"
```

**Expected Outcome**: Risk assessment categorized by impact level.

### Impact Assessment Matrix

| Usage Count | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1-5 uses    | Low        | Standard testing |
| 6-20 uses   | Medium     | Extended testing + review |
| 21-50 uses  | High       | Comprehensive testing + team review |
| 50+ uses    | Critical   | Phased rollout + extensive testing |

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Identified all direct dependencies
- [ ] Assessed indirect impact scope
- [ ] Categorized risk level
- [ ] Planned appropriate testing strategy

### Time Investment: 7-15 minutes
### Confidence Level After: 85-95% impact understanding

## Workflow 3: "Debugging and Tracing" - Problem Investigation

### When to Use
- Investigating bugs or unexpected behavior
- Tracing execution paths
- Understanding data flow
- Finding root causes

### Prerequisites
- Code dump already ingested
- Specific issue or area of concern identified
- Basic understanding of the problem domain

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Phase 1: Trace the Problem Area (3-5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. If you have a problematic function, find its callers
parseltongue query calls [problematic_function]

# 2. If you have a problematic struct/type, find its users
parseltongue query uses [ProblematicStruct]

# 3. Look for error handling patterns
parseltongue query uses Error
parseltongue query calls handle_error
parseltongue query what-implements Error
```

**Expected Outcome**: Understanding of how the problematic component is used and where errors might originate.

#### Phase 2: Follow the Data Flow (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# 4. Trace data flow through the system
# For message systems:
parseltongue query calls send_message
parseltongue query calls receive_message
parseltongue query calls process_message

# For web systems:
parseltongue query calls handle_request
parseltongue query calls process_response
parseltongue query calls middleware_chain

# 5. Find transformation points
parseltongue query calls serialize
parseltongue query calls deserialize
parseltongue query calls convert
parseltongue query calls transform
```

**Expected Outcome**: Clear picture of data flow and transformation points where issues might occur.

#### Phase 3: Identify Related Components (3-5 minutes)
```bash
# 6. Find components that might be related to the issue
parseltongue query uses [RelatedType1]
parseltongue query uses [RelatedType2]

# 7. Look for similar patterns that might have the same issue
parseltongue query what-implements [SimilarTrait]

# 8. Check for circular dependencies that might cause issues
parseltongue query find-cycles
```

**Expected Outcome**: Broader context of related components and potential systemic issues.

## Advanced Techniques

### Combining Workflows
- **New Codebase + Impact Analysis**: Use architectural understanding to better assess change impact
- **Impact Analysis + Debugging**: Use impact analysis to understand how bugs might propagate
- **All Three**: Complete analysis cycle for complex changes

### Domain-Specific Adaptations

#### Message Streaming Systems (like Iggy)
```bash
# Key patterns to look for:
parseltongue query what-implements ServerCommandHandler
parseltongue query uses IggyClient
parseltongue query calls send_messages
parseltongue query calls poll_messages
```

#### Web Frameworks
```bash
# Key patterns to look for:
parseltongue query what-implements Handler
parseltongue query uses Request
parseltongue query calls route
parseltongue query calls middleware
```

#### Database Systems
```bash
# Key patterns to look for:
parseltongue query what-implements Connection
parseltongue query uses Transaction
parseltongue query calls execute
parseltongue query calls commit
```

### Performance Tips
- **Batch queries**: Run multiple related queries in sequence
- **Use grep**: Filter results with `| grep pattern` for focused analysis
- **Save results**: Redirect output to files for complex analysis
- **Visualize first**: Use `parseltongue visualize` for overview before detailed queries

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many results | Use more specific entity names or grep filters |
| No results found | Check entity name spelling and case sensitivity |
| Unclear relationships | Use visualization to see connections |
| Missing context | Combine multiple query types for complete picture |
