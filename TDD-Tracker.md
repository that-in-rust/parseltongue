# Risk Management & Decision Log

## High-Risk Areas
1. **CozoDB Integration Complexity** - Local path dependency may require setup
2. **LLM API Integration** - Rate limiting, cost management, reliability
3. **Performance Targets** - <30s indexing for 50k LOC is aggressive
4. **Multi-language Support** - Tree-sitter integration complexity varies by language
5. **Ultra-Minimalist Constraints** - NO backup options may impact user experience

## Mitigation Strategies
1. **Prototype Early**: Implement core algorithms before full pipeline
2. **Performance Validation**: Implement performance tests from the beginning
3. **Incremental Integration**: Test each tool individually before pipeline integration
4. **Fallback Planning**: Alternative implementations for high-risk components

## Decision Log
- **Decision Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Architecture Finalization**: P01-P07 documents complete and approved
- **Implementation Approach**: TDD-first with ultra-minimalist MVP constraints
- **Target Timeline**: 4 weeks to complete MVP implementation
