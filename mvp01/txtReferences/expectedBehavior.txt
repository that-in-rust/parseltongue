Expected Behavior of OSS Code Analyzer and LLM-Ready Summarizer

When you run the program using `cargo run -- <input_zip_path> <output_directory_path>`, the following sequence of events will occur:

1. Command-Line Argument Parsing:
   - The program will use clap to parse the command-line arguments.
   - It expects two arguments: the path to an input ZIP file and the path to an output directory.
   - If these aren't provided correctly, it will display a help message explaining the required arguments.

2. Initialization:
   - The env_logger will be initialized for logging.
   - An info log message "Starting OSS Code Analyzer and LLM-Ready Summarizer" will be displayed.

3. Database Setup:
   - A DatabaseManager will be created in a "db" subdirectory within the specified output directory.
   - If this directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

4. Output Manager Setup:
   - An OutputManager will be initialized, ensuring the specified output directory exists.

5. ZIP File Processing Preparation:
   - The program will open the specified ZIP file.
   - It will create a ZipArchive object to handle the ZIP file contents.
   - A progress bar will be set up using indicatif to show the progress of file analysis.

6. Asynchronous ZIP Processing:
   - A new asynchronous task will be spawned using tokio to process the ZIP file.
   - This task will iterate through each file in the ZIP archive.
   - For each file, it will create a ZipEntry and send it through an asynchronous channel.

7. File Analysis:
   - The main thread will receive ZipEntry objects from the channel.
   - Each file will be analyzed to:
     a) Determine its language based on file extension.
     b) Count the lines of code.
   - The file content will be stored in the sled database.
   - The progress bar will update after each file is processed.

8. Summary Generation:
   - Once all files have been processed, a summary will be generated.
   - This summary will include:
     a) Details about each file (name, language, LOC)
     b) Total lines of code across all files
     c) Breakdown of languages used in the project

9. Output Writing:
   - The generated summary will be written to a file named "summary.json" in the specified output directory.
   - The summary will be in JSON format, written using a BufWriter for efficiency.

10. Completion:
    - A final log message "Analysis completed successfully" will be displayed.

Error Handling:
- Throughout the process, errors are handled using anyhow::Result.
- If any errors occur (e.g., ZIP file can't be opened, file analysis fails), appropriate error messages will be logged.

Performance Considerations:
- The program uses asynchronous processing for improved performance, especially for I/O operations.
- ZIP file contents are streamed rather than fully extracted, allowing for efficient memory usage.

Output:
- In the specified output directory, you'll find:
  a) A "db" subdirectory containing the sled database with stored file contents.
  b) A "summary.json" file with the analysis results.

Note: This is an MVP version. Future iterations may include more advanced features like parallel processing, incremental analysis, and more sophisticated language detection.
