  .query(&[
      ("q", &query),
      ("sort", &String::from("stars")),
      ("order", &String::from("desc"))
  ])  ```
- Alternatively, use a `Vec` of tuples for more flexibility:  ```rust

## 44. Error Handling in Builder Patterns

- When using builder patterns (like with `ProgressStyle`), handle potential errors from intermediate steps.
- Use `expect()` or proper error handling for methods that return `Result`, even in seemingly infallible operations.

## 45. Asynchronous Error Propagation

- In asynchronous contexts, ensure proper error propagation through the `await` chain.
- Use `?` operator with `await` to propagate errors in async functions.

## 46. Consistent Error Handling Strategy

- Choose a consistent error handling strategy throughout your project (e.g., using `anyhow::Result` for flexibility).
- Provide context to errors using `.context()` or similar methods to enhance debugging.

## 47. Modular Code Organization

- Regularly update dependencies to get bug fixes and security patches.
- Use `cargo update` to update dependencies within the specified version constraints.

## 59. Feature Flags and Conditional Compilation

- Use feature flags to manage optional dependencies and functionality.
- Be cautious when using unstable features and clearly document their usage.
- Use conditional compilation (`#[cfg(...)]`) to handle platform-specific code.

## 60. Documentation Practices

- Document any non-obvious import choices or dependency usage.
- Keep a changelog to track significant changes, including dependency updates.
- Use doc comments (`///`) to explain the purpose and usage of public items.

## 61. Ownership in Async Contexts

- Be cautious when moving values into async blocks or tasks.
- Ensure all types used in async contexts implement `Send` if they're to be used across await points.
- Use `Arc` for sharing ownership across threads, but remember that the original value is moved.

## 62. Working with External Crates in Async Contexts

- Check if types from external crates implement `Send` before using them in async tasks.
- Consider wrapping non-Send types in a mutex or creating a separate thread for blocking operations.
- Be aware that some operations (like file I/O) might not be async-friendly in all crates.

- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for operations that aren't `Send` or are CPU-intensive.
- Consider using `tokio::sync::Mutex` instead of `std::sync::Mutex` in async code.

## 64. Arc and Ownership

- Remember that wrapping a value in `Arc::new()` moves the value into the `Arc`.
- Use `Arc::clone()` to create new references to the same data.
- When passing an `Arc` to a function, consider passing a reference to the `Arc` instead of moving it.

## 65. Closure Ownership

- Be aware that closures capture their environment by default.
- Use the `move` keyword judiciously in closures to take ownership of captured variables.
- Consider using `Rc` or `Arc` for shared ownership in closures that outlive the current scope.

## 66. Unused Variables

- Prefix unused variables with an underscore to silence warnings.
- Remove unused parameters if they're not needed in the function implementation.
- Consider using `#[allow(unused_variables)]` attribute if the unused variable is intentional.

- When logging errors in async contexts, ensure the logger is cloned or referenced properly.
- Consider using a thread-safe logging mechanism that can be easily shared across async tasks.

## 68. Clippy Warnings

- Run `cargo clippy` regularly to catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code.
- Address clippy warnings promptly, as they often suggest more idiomatic or efficient code.
- Use `#[allow(clippy::...)]` attributes judiciously when you intentionally want to ignore a clippy warning.

## 69. Unused Parameters

- Remove unused parameters from function signatures if they're not needed.
- If the parameter might be used in the future, prefix it with an underscore to silence the warning.
- Document why an unused parameter is necessary if it can't be removed.

## 70. Efficient Use of References

- Avoid unnecessary borrowing, especially for arguments to generic functions.
- Let the compiler infer when to borrow and when to move, unless you have a specific reason to borrow.
- Use clippy's suggestions to remove needless borrows.

## 71. Efficient Use of PathBuf

- When passing a `PathBuf` to functions like `std::fs::File::create`, prefer passing by value rather than borrowing.
- Let the compiler handle the efficient passing of `PathBuf` arguments, as it's optimized for this use case.
- Use Clippy's suggestions to identify and remove needless borrows of `PathBuf` arguments.

## 72. Dependency and Import Synchronization

- Ensure that all crates used in the code are listed as dependencies in Cargo.toml.
- When removing a dependency from Cargo.toml, make sure to remove all related import statements and usages from the code.
- Use cargo check after modifying dependencies to catch any mismatches between code and Cargo.toml.
- Consider using tools like cargo-udeps to identify and remove unused dependencies.

## 73. Name Conflicts in Imports

- Be aware of potential name conflicts when importing from different crates.
- Use the `as` keyword to rename imports when conflicts occur.
- Consider using more specific imports (e.g., `use crate::specific_module::SpecificType`) to avoid conflicts.
- When using types from external crates, prefer to use the fully qualified path (e.g., `clap::Parser`) in the code instead of importing, if the type is only used once or twice.

## 74. Name Conflicts in Imports

- Be aware of potential name conflicts when importing from different crates.
- Use the `as` keyword to rename imports when conflicts occur.
- Consider using more specific imports (e.g., `use crate::specific_module::SpecificType`) to avoid conflicts.
- When using types from external crates, prefer to use the fully qualified path (e.g., `clap::Parser`) in the code instead of importing, if the type is only used once or twice.

## 75. Crate Feature Verification
