  .query(&[
      ("q", &query),
      ("sort", &String::from("stars")),
      ("order", &String::from("desc"))
  ])  ```
- Alternatively, use a `Vec` of tuples for more flexibility:  ```rust

- Regularly update dependencies to get bug fixes and security patches.
- Use `cargo update` to update dependencies within the specified version constraints.

## 59. Feature Flags and Conditional Compilation

- Use feature flags to manage optional dependencies and functionality.
- Be cautious when using unstable features and clearly document their usage.
- Use conditional compilation (`#[cfg(...)]`) to handle platform-specific code.

## 60. Documentation Practices

- Document any non-obvious import choices or dependency usage.
- Keep a changelog to track significant changes, including dependency updates.
- Use doc comments (`///`) to explain the purpose and usage of public items.

## 61. Ownership in Async Contexts

- Be cautious when moving values into async blocks or tasks.
- Ensure all types used in async contexts implement `Send` if they're to be used across await points.
- Use `Arc` for sharing ownership across threads, but remember that the original value is moved.

## 62. Working with External Crates in Async Contexts

- Check if types from external crates implement `Send` before using them in async tasks.
- Consider wrapping non-Send types in a mutex or creating a separate thread for blocking operations.
- Be aware that some operations (like file I/O) might not be async-friendly in all crates.

## 63. Tokio Task Spawning

- Ensure that futures passed to `tokio::spawn` are `Send`.
- Use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for operations that aren't `Send` or are CPU-intensive.
- Consider using `tokio::sync::Mutex` instead of `std::sync::Mutex` in async code.

## 64. Arc and Ownership

- Remember that wrapping a value in `Arc::new()` moves the value into the `Arc`.
- Use `Arc::clone()` to create new references to the same data.
- When passing an `Arc` to a function, consider passing a reference to the `Arc` instead of moving it.

## 65. Closure Ownership

- Be aware that closures capture their environment by default.
- Use the `move` keyword judiciously in closures to take ownership of captured variables.
- Consider using `Rc` or `Arc` for shared ownership in closures that outlive the current scope.

## 66. Unused Variables

- Consider using a thread-safe logging mechanism that can be easily shared across async tasks.

## 68. Clippy Warnings

- Run `cargo clippy` regularly to catch common mistakes and non-idiomatic code.
- Address clippy warnings promptly, as they often suggest more idiomatic or efficient code.
- Use `#[allow(clippy::...)]` attributes judiciously when you intentionally want to ignore a clippy warning.

## 69. Unused Parameters

- Remove unused parameters from function signatures if they're not needed.
- If the parameter might be used in the future, prefix it with an underscore to silence the warning.
- Document why an unused parameter is necessary if it can't be removed.

## 70. Efficient Use of References

- Avoid unnecessary borrowing, especially for arguments to generic functions.
- Let the compiler infer when to borrow and when to move, unless you have a specific reason to borrow.
- Use clippy's suggestions to remove needless borrows.

## 71. Efficient Use of PathBuf

- When passing a `PathBuf` to functions like `std::fs::File::create`, prefer passing by value rather than borrowing.
- Let the compiler handle the efficient passing of `PathBuf` arguments, as it's optimized for this use case.
- Use Clippy's suggestions to identify and remove needless borrows of `PathBuf` arguments.

## 72. Dependency and Import Synchronization

- Ensure that all crates used in the code are listed as dependencies in Cargo.toml.
- When removing a dependency from Cargo.toml, make sure to remove all related import statements and usages from the code.
- Use cargo check after modifying dependencies to catch any mismatches between code and Cargo.toml.
- Consider using tools like cargo-udeps to identify and remove unused dependencies.

## 73. Name Conflicts in Imports

- Be aware of potential name conflicts when importing from different crates.
- Use the `as` keyword to rename imports when conflicts occur.
- Consider using more specific imports (e.g., `use crate::specific_module::SpecificType`) to avoid conflicts.
- When using types from external crates, prefer to use the fully qualified path (e.g., `clap::Parser`) in the code instead of importing, if the type is only used once or twice.

## 74. Name Conflicts in Imports

- Be aware of potential name conflicts when importing from different crates.
- Use the `as` keyword to rename imports when conflicts occur.
- Consider using more specific imports (e.g., `use crate::specific_module::SpecificType`) to avoid conflicts.
- When using types from external crates, prefer to use the fully qualified path (e.g., `clap::Parser`) in the code instead of importing, if the type is only used once or twice.

## 86. Correct Cargo.toml Placement
- Ensure that the Cargo.toml file is placed in the root of your project directory.
- For workspace projects, each sub-project should have its own Cargo.toml file in its root directory.
- Avoid having multiple Cargo.toml files at different levels of your project structure unless you're intentionally using a workspace.
- Always run Cargo commands from the directory containing the Cargo.toml file for your current project or sub-project.

## Build Process and Code Generation

- Ensure that build scripts (build.rs) correctly generate all required files.
- Verify that generated files are created in the expected locations.
- Add error checking and logging in build scripts to catch and report issues during the build process.
- Use conditional compilation to handle cases where generated files might not exist.
- Implement a pre-build check to ensure all necessary tools (like protoc) are installed and accessible.

## 89. Protobuf and Generated Code
- When using protobuf-generated types, ensure they are properly imported in your Rust files.
- Verify that your `build.rs` script is correctly set up to generate Rust code from your `.proto` files.
- Always regenerate protobuf code after making changes to `.proto` files.
- Include generated protobuf code in your version control to avoid build issues on systems without protoc installed.

## 90. Protobuf File Management
- Ensure that all .proto files referenced in build.rs actually exist in the specified locations.
- Double-check the paths in build.rs to make sure they're correct relative to the project root.
- When using protobuf, always create the necessary .proto files before attempting to build the project.
- Consider adding a pre-build check in build.rs to verify the existence of required .proto files.

## 91. Absolute Paths in Build Scripts

- Use the suggested fixes, such as adding an import or defining a missing type.

## 96. Be Mindful of External Crate Requirements

- When using external crates (like `tree-sitter`), ensure you understand their API.
- Some methods may require additional arguments (e.g., `node.children(&mut cursor)`).
- Refer to the crate's documentation for correct usage.

## 97. Always Define the `main` Function

- Ensure that your Rust application has a `main` function as the entry point.
- For async applications using Tokio, use `#[tokio::main]` above your `main` function.

## 98. Import Traits for Methods Used

- If you use methods from traits, ensure the trait is in scope.
- For example, `anyhow::Context` provides the `context` method for `Result` and `Option`.
- Import the trait: `use anyhow::Context;`.

## 99. Pay Attention to Function Signatures

- Ensure that function signatures match the expected usage.
- For example, when defining `Result<T>`, specify both `T` and `E`, like `Result<T, E>`.

## 100. Keep Struct and Enum Definitions Accessible

- Place struct and enum definitions in places where they are accessible to functions that need them.
- If a struct is used in multiple modules, consider placing it in a shared module.

## 101. Use Correct Tree-sitter Language Functions

- Import tree-sitter language functions directly from their crates.
- Avoid declaring `extern "C"` functions for tree-sitter languages.
- Example:  ```rust
  use tree_sitter_rust::language as rust_language;  ```

## 102. Define Types Before Use

- Ensure all structs and enums are defined before they're used in functions.
- Rust allows forward declarations within the same module, but definitions must be in scope.

## 103. Handle Name Conflicts with Aliases

- When importing items with the same name from different crates, use `as` to alias them.
- Example:  ```rust
  use clap::Parser as ClapParser;  ```
- This avoids conflicts and clarifies which item you're referring to.

## 104. Clean Up Unused Imports

- Remove unused imports to reduce warnings and potential confusion.
- Use tools like `cargo clippy` to help identify unused code.

## 105. Ensure Correct Command Usage
