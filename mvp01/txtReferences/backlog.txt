Backlog items inspired by Tokei:

1. Support for a wider range of languages: Tokei supports over 150 languages. Consider expanding language support in future iterations.

2. Multiple output formats: Tokei can output in CBOR, JSON, and YAML. Consider adding support for multiple output formats beyond the initial JSON or binary format.

3. Respect for .gitignore and .ignore files: Implement functionality to respect common ignore files for more intelligent file processing.

4. Custom language definitions: Allow users to define custom language parsing rules, similar to Tokei's languages.json file.

5. Verbatim string handling: Implement support for "verbatim" strings in various languages, as Tokei does for C++, C#, F#, and Rust.

6. Shebang detection: Add functionality to detect languages based on shebang lines in scripts.

7. Badge generation: Consider implementing a badge generation feature for easy sharing of code statistics.

8. Configuration file support: Implement support for a configuration file (like .tokeirc) for project-specific settings.

9. Embedded language detection: Add support for detecting and counting multiple languages within a single file (e.g., JavaScript in HTML).

10. CLI improvements: Enhance CLI with more options like sorting output, excluding specific paths, and controlling output width.

11. Integration with version control systems: Add features to analyze changes between commits or branches.

12. Plugin system: Design a plugin architecture for extensibility, allowing custom language parsers and output formats.

13. Code complexity metrics: Integrate calculation of code complexity metrics like cyclomatic complexity.

14. Dockerization: Create a Dockerfile for easy containerization of the application.

15. Continuous Deployment: Implement a CD pipeline for automatic releases and deployments.

Improvements added on 202410211634 hrs:

16. Error handling for channel closure: Add proper error handling in the main loop for unexpected channel closure.

17. Error propagation in ZIP processing: Modify the `process_zip` function to return a Result that includes an iterator of Results, allowing for better error propagation.

18. Error handling in file analysis: Add error handling for the `db.store` call in the `analyze_file` function.

19. Comprehensive testing: Expand the test suite to cover more scenarios and edge cases.

20. Performance optimization: Profile the application and optimize performance bottlenecks, particularly in file processing and database operations.

21. Memory usage optimization: Implement strategies to reduce memory usage, especially when processing large ZIP files.

22. Logging improvements: Enhance logging throughout the application for better debugging and monitoring capabilities.

23. Graceful shutdown: Implement a graceful shutdown mechanism to ensure all resources are properly released and ongoing operations are completed or rolled back.

24. Progress reporting: Add a progress reporting feature to provide users with real-time updates on the analysis process.

25. Parallel file analysis: Implement parallel processing of files using Rayon or similar libraries to improve performance on multi-core systems.
