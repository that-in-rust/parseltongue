You're seeking a radical approach to compressing and encoding the essence of open-source projects into an LLM-digestible format. I love the ambitious scope! Here's a refined, radical plan:

Forget Extraction: Do not extract the entire ZIP archive to a temporary directory. That's inefficient. Instead, use a ZIP/archive library in Rust (zip, tar) to directly stream file contents from the archive. This greatly reduces disk I/O and memory usage.

DatabaseA = sled: Yes, sled is a good fit. Its embedded key-value store nature aligns with this project well, as it has really great performance, even though it works with a file on disk. Create the database in folderB. Within it:

Use keys for file paths (repo/path/to/file.rs).

No "Important Information" Pre-selection: Your initial goal is maximal compression. Don't pre-filter "important" code elements. The LLM (like me!) can do that.

Targeted Parsers: Inside the loop that streams each file from the ZIP:

If the file is in one of your target languages (Rust, JS, Java, C++, C, Python), run your targeted parsers. These must still produce simplified, semantic ASTs as before, removing comments, whitespace, etc.

Serialize these compressed ASTs immediately into sled under the file's path key. If the AST needs to be chunked, it might be wise to implement an offset number as part of the key like this repo/path/to/file.rs.ast/24. This stores them in the database rather than separately like with Chromium described before.

For all other files (config files, documentation, images), compress them losslessly (gzip or similar), and also store the compressed content in sled under their path keys. Why? LLMs are great at dealing with many data formats, including compressed files.

Symbol Tables: As before, handle these lazily as you parse code files. Store the symbol tables within sled under their language keys (rust_symbols, java_symbols, javascript_symbols etc...).

Encryption: Forget Encryption for the MVP. It adds complexity with little benefit initially. LLMs understand compressed data, ASTs, and serialized data structures!

If security is needed later, encrypt sled itself or add database-level encryption.

The LLM-Readable Text File is sled: The sled database is your output file. It holds:

Compressed ASTs of code

Compressed versions of all other files

Symbol tables

This allows flexible, future exploration, driven by your LLM.

Process Progress File: Easy in Rust. Log progress information (files processed, languages encountered, AST sizes, compression ratios, errors, timing data, database statistics etc) as a JSON for later analysis (using serde).

Logging to log.txt: Use the log crate for error logging, debug messages, and any other information during your tool's execution. Rotate logs.

Final Approach:

Input: ZIP archive path, working directory
      ▼
      Open archive (streaming) +  Create sled Database
      ▼        
      LOOP through files:
      |--> If Code (Rust, JS, etc.): Parse -> AST -> [Lazy Symbols] -> Serialize to sled
      |--> Else: Compress and Serialize to sled   
      ▼       
      Output: sled database  +  progress file  +  log file
content_copy
Use code with caution.

Why is this radical?

No Extraction: Maximum efficiency for massive projects by directly reading the archive contents in stream without storing intermediate outputs.

All-Inclusive Representation: Compress everything into a single key-value database (ASTs, data files, metadata). LLMs deal with compressed contents too.

Forget Encryption (for MVP): Let LLMs parse other structured and unstructured information, they don't always need plaintext.

This eliminates unnecessary steps and I/O bottlenecks. And it makes exploration much more efficient since your LLM has access to everything compressed, so finding out something like “what proportion of JavaScript files is compressed beyond a certain ratio and the kind of libraries being referenced” becomes feasible because the data to answer questions like that is available directly. You will, if not already using something like TypeScript etc, be required to either maintain that information outside in a database or separate process using just filenames etc at this point or generate it when this data is generated. This is truly weird encryption, or possibly rather encoding would be a more apt word, in a way - but it is also incredibly effective and versatile, with LLMs able to drive very flexible analyses with efficient random access via sled. You do however have to be absolutely sure how to expand them using external mappings if it ever becomes necessary.

=======================================

next one 

You are absolutely correct! My apologies. I got carried away with the sled database being the primary output and forgot the crucial step of creating the final summary file for the LLM.

Here's the adjusted flow, including the missing piece:

Stream from ZIP, Store in sled: As before, stream file contents from the ZIP archive and store the compressed ASTs or losslessly compressed data into sled under their respective file paths. Also, store the symbol tables in sled.

Generate LLM-Ready Summary: After processing all files in the ZIP:

Iterate through the contents of the sled database.

For each entry (file path -> compressed content):

Generate a concise, structured summary for each file (JSON is a good choice). Include:

File Path

Language (if code)

Size (original and compressed)

Compression Ratio (if applicable)

(Optional): Basic stats (lines, code, blanks) extracted before radical compression if your parsers are capable of generating that efficiently (just use tokei before serialization to sled as was your intent before).

Append this compressed JSON summary to your LLM-ready text file.

LLM-Ready Text File: This file now contains the concatenated, compressed JSON summaries of every file. It's not the database itself. It is the final output of the tool's execution as was your original intent and makes asking questions about specific files within an open source library easier without knowing specifics or internal naming conventions about the actual internal sled database. Use a - or another character as a separator to clearly identify boundaries between entries in the final file, it helps simplify LLM processing. The LLM does not care about what or how you serialize it, as long as there's a marker.

Output: The working directory (folderB) contains:

The sled database (for caching or if your LLM uses it during answering, and for reconstruction of originals if ever needed.)

LLM-ready-<timestamp>.txt (compressed JSON summaries)

processProgress.txt

log.txt

Corrected Final Approach:

Input: ZIP, working directory
         ▼
         Open ZIP (streaming) + Create sled Database
         ▼
         LOOP through ZIP entries:
            |--> Parse (if code), compress, store in sled
         ▼
         LOOP through sled:
            |--> Create compressed JSON summary (per file), append to LLM file 
         ▼
         Output: sled, LLM-ready-<timestamp>.txt, progress, logs
content_copy
Use code with caution.

The sled database is still highly valuable as a cache and allows flexible investigation of a library’s content or easy recovery of original data (the LLM summary likely doesn't contain every single AST detail and is highly compressed.) It may also help if your LLM uses it at runtime when interacting. But the LLM-ready-<timestamp>.txt file becomes the primary interface for more general LLM inquiries based on the open-source projects.

This approach aligns better with your requirements and preserves the important aspect of having an aggregated, compressed, LLM-friendly file for analysis.

If compression of this new JSON output is not "weird" enough to reach your desired compression target, consider some kind of protobuf output with just essentials or another custom structured, possibly binary output for even greater compression.
