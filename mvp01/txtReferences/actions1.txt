Implement Advanced Code Analysis
Integrate tree-sitter for AST generation and deeper code analysis.
Extract detailed metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity using relevant crates or custom implementations.
Develop and integrate custom lint rules to detect project-specific code smells and anti-patterns.
Enhance LLM-ready Output Generation
Implement Protocol Buffers serialization using the prost crate.
Apply multi-layer compression techniques (syntactic, semantic, graph) using flate2, custom dictionary-based compression, and spectral sparsification.
Ensure the output file is placed correctly with a timestamp.
Comprehensive Testing Suite
Develop comprehensive unit tests for all modules using #[cfg(test)].
Implement integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality with real-world codebases.
Add tests for various error scenarios to ensure robust error handling.
Implement Disk Usage Management
Introduce compression strategies for the final output using flate2 or similar crates.
Ensure efficient disk usage by managing output directories and deleting temporary files as needed.
Advanced Logging and Debugging
Enhance the logging system to include thematic, Avengers-inspired logging using crates like colored for terminal output.
Implement detailed error tracing with stack traces using the backtrace crate.
Set up advanced progress tracking visuals, such as themed progress bars.
Performance Optimization
Implement adaptive batch processing to dynamically adjust based on system resources.
Optimize async processing further to maximize throughput.
Profile the application using tools like perf or valgrind to identify and address bottlenecks.
Code Cleanliness and Dependency Management
Continuously run clippy to catch and fix common code issues.
Audit and remove unused dependencies and imports to maintain a clean codebase.
Optimize the use of references and borrows for better performance and readability.
