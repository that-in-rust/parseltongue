# AST-Grep Codebase Analysis Reading Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic approach to analyze the ast-grep codebase documentation file (`docs/ast-grep-ast-grep-8a5edab282632443.txt`) in 300-line increments to extract comprehensive future parseltongue workflows.

## File Analysis Summary
- **Total Lines**: 63,985 lines
- **Processing Method**: 300-line chunks with 20-line overlap for context continuity
- **Total Chunks**: 214 chunks (rounded up from 213.28)
- **Content Type**: Complete ast-grep codebase dump including directory structure, configuration files, and source code

## File Structure Analysis
The file is organized as follows:
1. **Lines 1-200**: Directory structure overview
2. **Lines 200+**: Individual file contents marked with `FILE: filename` separators
3. **Content includes**:
   - Configuration files (Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, etc.)
   - Source code files (.rs files)
   - Documentation (README.md)
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Test files and examples

## Processing Strategy

### Chunk Size and Overlap
- **Primary Chunk Size**: 300 lines
- **Overlap Size**: 20 lines (to maintain context across chunks)
- **Effective New Content per Chunk**: 280 lines

### Analytical Framework Application
For each 300-line chunk, apply the superintelligence analytical framework:

1. **Deconstruct & Clarify**: Identify core objectives and domain complexity in the chunk
2. **Cognitive Staging**: Activate expert personas:
   - Technical Architect (parseltongue internals and Rust ecosystem)
   - Product Strategist (developer experience and market positioning)
   - DevOps Engineer (CI/CD integration and operational concerns)
   - Developer Experience Specialist (workflow optimization and tooling)
   - Skeptical Engineer (challenge assumptions and identify risks)
3. **Multi-Perspective Exploration**: Use conceptual blending and structured debate
4. **Verification**: Generate 5-10 fact-checkable questions per major claim

### Extraction Categories

#### User Journeys
- **Individual Developer**: Solo development workflows
- **Team Lead**: Team coordination and code quality workflows
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD and operational workflows
- **Platform Engineer**: Large-scale and infrastructure workflows

#### Technical Insights
