# UJ-001: Library Migration Assistant

## Overview
**Persona**: Open-Source Library Author
**Workflow Type**: Development/Migration
**Source**: Chunk 2, Lines 301-600
**Priority**: High

## Current Pain Points
- Breaking changes require extensive manual migration guides
- Users struggle with complex API transformations across large codebases
- Migration adoption is slow and error-prone, leading to fragmented ecosystem
- Manual migration documentation becomes outdated quickly
- Support burden increases with each breaking change

## Proposed Solution
**Core Workflow**: Automated migration script generation using ast-grep pattern matching
- Define transformation patterns for API changes using intuitive syntax
- Batch process entire codebases with single command execution
- Generate migration reports showing all changes made
- Provide rollback capabilities for failed migrations
- Integration with package manager update workflows

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Example migration command
ast-grep --pattern 'oldAPI($ARGS)' --rewrite 'newAPI($ARGS)' --lang js --recursive
```

## Success Metrics
- **Time Reduction**: Migration time reduced from days to hours (80%+ improvement)
- **Accuracy**: 90%+ automated transformation accuracy with minimal manual intervention
- **Adoption Rate**: Increased breaking change adoption rate by 60%
- **Support Reduction**: 70% reduction in migration-related support requests

## Integration Tools
- **Version Control**: Git hooks for automated migration PR generation
- **CI/CD**: Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI for automated testing
- **Package Managers**: npm, cargo, pip integration for seamless updates
- **Documentation**: Automated migration guide generation
- **Communication**: Slack/Discord bots for migration notifications

## Expected Outcomes
- **Faster Library Evolution**: Reduced fear of breaking changes enables more aggressive API improvements
- **Improved User Experience**: Seamless migration experience increases user satisfaction
- **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Automated migration reduces support overhead
- **Ecosystem Health**: Faster adoption of security fixes and improvements

## Implementation Requirements
- Pattern template library for common migration scenarios
- Integration APIs for popular package managers
- Rollback and safety mechanisms for failed migrations
- Comprehensive testing framework for migration validation
- Documentation generation for migration changes

## Cross-References
- **Technical Insight**: TI-001 (Isomorphic Pattern Matching)
- **Strategic Theme**: ST-001 (AST Democratization)
- **Related Journeys**: UJ-002 (Code Standardization)

## Parseltongue Integration Opportunities
- **Semantic Context**: Use parseltongue's relationship analysis to understand migration impact
- **Dependency Tracking**: Leverage ISG to identify all affected code paths
- **Risk Assessment**: Combine with blast radius analysis for safer migrations
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate migration impact reports using semantic understanding
