# UJ-042: Intelligent Dead Code Elimination

## Overview
Safely identify and remove dead code through multi-stage filtering that combines semantic analysis, syntactic checks, and impact quantification.

## User Journey Details

**Persona**: Platform Engineer / Tech Lead
**Workflow Type**: Code Maintenance / Technical Debt Reduction
**Complexity**: High
**Frequency**: Monthly maintenance cycles

## Current Pain Points
- High false positive rates in traditional dead code detection
- Manual verification of removal safety is extremely time-intensive
- Lack of quantified impact assessment for cleanup efforts
- Difficulty distinguishing between truly dead code and conditionally compiled code
- Risk of removing code that's dynamically invoked or used in tests

## Proposed Solution
Dead Code Exorcist using progressive refinement: semantic analysis identifies candidates → syntactic filtering eliminates false positives → metrics quantification assesses impact → LLM generates removal scripts and documentation.

### Workflow Steps
1. Parseltongue identifies all functions with zero callers in ISG (semantic scan)
2. Apply syntactic filters using grep to eliminate false positives:
   - String literal references (dynamic invocation)
   - Conditional compilation blocks (#[cfg])
   - Test/benchmark annotations (#[test], #[bench])
3. Use cloc to quantify removal impact (lines of code eliminated)
4. Generate LLM prompts for automated removal scripts and commit messages

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 95% reduction in false positives compared to simple dead code detection
- **Efficiency**: 80% reduction in manual verification time
- **Impact**: Quantified technical debt reduction with precise metrics
- **Safety**: Zero accidental removal of functional code through multi-stage validation

## Integration Requirements

### Tools Required
- Parseltongue (semantic analysis for caller identification)
- grep (syntactic pattern matching for false positive filtering)
- cloc (code metrics and impact quantification)
- LLM integration (automated script generation and documentation)

### Technical Dependencies
- ISG traversal for caller analysis
- Pattern matching for conditional compilation detection
- Code metrics calculation and baseline comparison
- Script generation templates for safe code removal

## Expected Outcomes
- Safe, automated codebase maintenance with comprehensive audit trail
- Quantified technical debt reduction with measurable impact
- Establish pattern for high-confidence automation through multi-tool triangulation
- Create developer trust in automated maintenance through rigorous validation

## Implementation Priority
**Medium** - Important for long-term codebase health but not daily workflow critical
