# User Journey: Plugin Ecosystem Development

## Persona
**Platform Engineer / Tool Maintainer**

## Workflow Type
**Community & Extensibility**

## Current Pain Points
- Plugin systems in developer tools often sacrifice performance for flexibility
- Security concerns with untrusted code execution in development environments
- Fragmented plugin ecosystems with incompatible APIs and standards
- Difficulty maintaining plugin compatibility across tool versions
- Limited discoverability and quality assurance for community plugins

## Proposed Solution
**Performance-First Plugin Ecosystem with Community Governance**

Implement a layered plugin system that maintains Parseltongue's <1ms query performance while enabling community extensibility:

1. **Trait-Based Plugin Architecture**: Zero-cost abstractions through Rust traits
2. **Multi-Tier Security Model**: WASM sandboxing for untrusted plugins, native compilation for verified plugins
3. **Performance Budget System**: Each plugin declares and enforces its performance impact
4. **Community Registry**: Git-based decentralized registry with peer review process
5. **Plugin Promotion Pathway**: WASM â†’ Native promotion based on community validation

## Success Metrics
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintain <1ms query performance with 5+ active plugins
- **Security Assurance**: Zero security incidents from community plugins in first year
- **Community Growth**: 50+ community plugins within 6 months of launch
- **Quality Standards**: 90%+ plugin compatibility across minor version updates
- **Developer Adoption**: 25% of Parseltongue users actively use community plugins

## Integration Tools
- **Cargo Integration**: Plugin installation through `cargo install parseltongue-plugin-<name>`
- **IDE Extensions**: Plugin-enhanced LSP capabilities for popular editors
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Plugin-based architectural validation in build processes
- **Documentation Tools**: Automatic plugin API documentation generation

## Expected Outcomes
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Vibrant community of plugin developers extending Parseltongue capabilities
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Custom enterprise plugins enable organization-specific workflows
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Community-driven innovation in architectural analysis tools
- **Market Leadership**: Establish Parseltongue as the extensible platform for Rust development tools

## Implementation Requirements
- Plugin trait system with performance contracts
- WASM runtime with security sandboxing
- Community registry with automated testing
- Plugin development toolkit and documentation
- Governance model for community standards
