# User Journey: Intelligent CI/CD Quality Gates

### Basic Information
- **Journey ID**: UJ-010
- **Source**: DTNote01.md chunks 21-40 (lines 5981-12000)
- **Extraction Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Persona**: DevOps Engineer (Platform Team)
- **Workflow Type**: CI/CD - Automated Quality Assurance

### Journey Details

#### Current State Analysis
**Current Pain Points**:
- CI pipelines run all tests even for small changes (wasting 70-80% of compute resources)
- No automated understanding of change impact scope
- Manual code review bottlenecks for architectural concerns
- Difficulty prioritizing review attention based on risk level
- Over-conservative test execution leads to long feedback cycles

**Current Workflow**:
Developer pushes changes → CI runs full test suite → manual review process → merge decision based on limited impact understanding

**Time Investment**:
20-45 minutes per PR for CI execution, 30-60 minutes for thorough review

#### Proposed Solution
**Solution Overview**:
Parseltongue-powered CI that automatically determines test scope and review requirements based on blast radius analysis and semantic change impact

**Key Parseltongue Features Utilized**:
- Blast radius analysis for change impact assessment
- Dependency graph traversal for affected component identification
- Semantic diff analysis beyond textual changes
- Integration with CI/CD platforms for automated decision making

**Integration Tools Required**:
- GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipeline integration
- Parseltongue blast-radius analysis engine
- Automated test discovery and execution tools
- PR review bot with architectural awareness

#### Expected Outcomes

**Success Metrics**:
- 60% reduction in CI execution time for small changes
- 90% accuracy in identifying changes requiring architectural review
- 40% faster PR merge times
- 50% reduction in compute resource usage for CI/CD

**Business Value**:
- Significant cost savings on CI/CD infrastructure
- Faster developer feedback cycles
- Improved code quality through targeted reviews
- Reduced bottlenecks in development workflow

**Technical Benefits**:
- Intelligent resource allocation based on change impact
- Automated architectural policy enforcement
- Context-aware test execution strategies
- Scalable quality assurance that adapts to codebase complexity

### Implementation Details

**Prerequisites**:
- Parseltongue ISG analysis integrated with CI/CD platform
- Blast radius analysis capability for target repositories
- Test discovery and categorization system
- CI/CD platform API access for dynamic workflow modification

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Developer pushes changes to feature branch
2. Parseltongue analyzes blast radius and semantic impact
3. CI system dynamically selects relevant test subset
4. Parallel execution of targeted tests with impact-based prioritization
5. Automated review assignment based on architectural impact
6. Context-rich PR review packet generated for human reviewers

**Error Handling**:
- Conservative fallback to full test suite if analysis fails
- Graceful degradation with partial semantic information
- Manual override capabilities for special cases

### Verification Questions
1. Can blast radius analysis reliably determine CI test scope with 90% accuracy?
2. Will the performance overhead of analysis offset the CI time savings?
3. How does this handle complex dependency scenarios like runtime polymorphism?

**Verification Answers**:
1. Yes - parseltongue's dependency tracking can identify affected code paths with high accuracy; conservative fallbacks handle edge cases
2. No - blast radius analysis is typically <30s while CI savings are measured in minutes to hours
3. Parseltongue handles most static analysis scenarios; dynamic cases trigger conservative test selection
