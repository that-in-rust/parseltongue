# User Journey: Clinical-Grade Performance Validation

## Overview
**ID:** UJ-026  
**Title:** Clinical-Grade Performance Validation  
**Persona:** Technical Lead  
**Workflow Type:** Tool Evaluation & Adoption  
**Source:** DTNote01.md chunks 161-180 (lines 47981-54000)

## Current Pain Points
- Unverified performance claims from tool vendors
- Inconsistent behavior across different codebase sizes
- Lack of real-world validation data
- Risk of performance regressions in production
- Marketing hyperbole vs actual performance
- Difficulty comparing tools objectively

## Proposed Solution
Systematic performance validation with evidence-based contracts using medical-grade rigor:

### Performance Contract Framework
**Discovery Performance Contracts:**
- Entity Discovery: <30 seconds (achieved: 86ms)
- Query Success Rate: >90% (achieved: 95%+)
- Interactive Response: <100ms (achieved: 15ms)

**Workflow Performance Contracts:**
- Onboarding: <15 minutes (achieved: 88s for Axum framework)
- Feature Planning: <5 minutes (achieved: 2.3min)
- Debug Analysis: <3 minutes (achieved: 1.8min)

**System Performance Contracts:**
- Existing Queries: <50μs (achieved: 23μs)
- Memory Increase: <20% (achieved: 12%)
- Large Codebase Ingestion: <30s (achieved: 9.0s for 127 files)

### Real-World Validation Methodology
**Validation Targets:**
- **Axum Framework:** 295 files, 1,147 entities → 88 seconds onboarding
- **Parseltongue Self-Analysis:** 127 files, 847 entities → 54 seconds analysis
- **Large Codebases:** 1000+ files → <15 minutes consistent performance
- **Memory Efficiency:** 12MB for 127-file codebase, 67% reduction with string interning

### Evidence-Based Claims
- All performance targets exceeded by significant margins
- Real-world validation on production codebases
- Transparent methodology with reproducible results
- Statistical significance across diverse environments

## Success Metrics
### Performance Validation
