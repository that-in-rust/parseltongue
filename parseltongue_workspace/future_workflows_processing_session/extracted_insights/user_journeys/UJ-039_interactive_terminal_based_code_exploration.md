# User Journey: Interactive Terminal-Based Code Exploration

**ID**: UJ-039
**Source**: DTNotes03.md - Interactive ISG Explorer
**Persona**: Individual Developer, Platform Engineer
**Workflow Type**: Development, Architecture Analysis

## Current Pain Points
- Terminal environments lack IDE-like semantic navigation capabilities
- Context switching between command-line tools and graphical IDEs
- No interactive way to explore architectural relationships in terminal
- Limited discoverability of entities and their relationships
- Cumbersome navigation between entity definitions, callers, and impact analysis

## Proposed Solution
Implement Interactive ISG Explorer that provides IDE-like semantic navigation in terminal environments:

- Fuzzy search through all entities using fzf
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for different actions
- Direct integration with editor for seamless code opening
- Interactive exploration of architectural relationships
- Terminal-native interface with rich interaction patterns

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Interactive entity exploration with fzf integration
./pt-explore.sh

# Features:
# - Fuzzy search through entity list
# - [Enter] Open Definition in editor
# - [Ctrl+C] Show Callers and generate debug report
# - [Ctrl+I] Show Impact analysis
# - Configurable FZF options for optimal UX
```

## Success Metrics
- **Navigation Speed**: 70% faster entity discovery and exploration
- **Terminal Productivity**: Reduced need for IDE context switching
- **Discoverability**: 90% of relevant entities found through fuzzy search
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless integration with existing terminal workflows

## Integration Requirements
- fzf (fuzzy finder) for interactive selection
- Parseltongue entity listing with configurable limits
- Editor integration (vim, code, emacs, etc.)
- Configurable keyboard bindings and actions
- Terminal environment with proper key handling

## Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced terminal-based development experience
- Reduced context switching between tools and environments
- Faster architectural exploration and understanding
- Improved discoverability of codebase entities
- IDE-like capabilities in lightweight terminal environment

## Dependencies
- fzf installation and configuration
- Parseltongue entity listing functionality
- Text editor with command-line interface
- Shell environment with proper key binding support
- Terminal with advanced input handling

## Priority
**Medium-High** - Significantly improves terminal-based development workflow
