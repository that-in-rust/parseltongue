# UJ-031: Git-Integrated Architectural Guardians

## Overview
**Persona**: Team Lead, DevOps Engineer  
**Workflow Type**: CI/CD, Quality Assurance  
**Source**: DTNote02.md - Git Hooks and CI Automation  
**Strategic Theme**: Performance-First Architecture Culture, Symbiotic Tool Ecosystem Integration

## Current Pain Points
- Architectural violations discovered late in development cycle during code review
- No automated prevention of circular dependencies before they enter codebase
- High-risk changes lack visibility until after merge
- Manual architectural review is time-intensive and inconsistent
- Technical debt accumulates without early intervention

## Proposed Solution
Integrate Parseltongue into Git workflow through automated hooks and CI-generated review packets:

**Git Hook Integration**:
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Run `parseltongue query find-cycles` to block circular dependencies
- **Pre-push Hook**: Execute `parseltongue query blast-radius` on staged changes, reject "High" or "Critical" risk without explicit override (`--no-verify`)

**CI/CD Review Packet Generation**:
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automatically generate comprehensive PR review artifacts
- **Generated Artifacts**: Interactive HTML graphs, JSON context packs, markdown reports, blast radius analysis
- **Reviewer Tools**: Upload artifacts to PR for both human and AI reviewer consumption

## Success Metrics
- **Prevention Rate**: Percentage of architectural violations caught before merge
- **Review Efficiency**: Reduction in time spent on manual architectural review
- **Technical Debt**: Measurable reduction in circular dependencies and high-risk changes
- **Developer Velocity**: Maintained or improved despite additional quality gates

## Integration Requirements
- **Git Hooks**: Lightweight execution with sub-second latency for pre-commit checks
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins pipeline support
- **Override Mechanism**: `--no-verify` flag for emergency situations
- **Artifact Generation**: HTML visualizations, JSON context, markdown reports
- **Failure Handling**: Graceful degradation when Parseltongue analysis unavailable

## Expected Outcomes
- Architectural quality gates become automatic and non-intrusive
- Teams prevent technical debt accumulation through early intervention
- Code reviewers receive rich context about architectural impact of changes
- High-risk changes are identified and handled with appropriate scrutiny
- Consistent architectural standards across development teams

## Implementation Notes
- Balance strictness with developer productivity to avoid becoming friction source
- Provide clear error messages and remediation guidance
- Support configurable risk thresholds for different project needs
- Include comprehensive documentation for hook setup and configuration
- Ensure hooks work reliably across different Git hosting platforms
