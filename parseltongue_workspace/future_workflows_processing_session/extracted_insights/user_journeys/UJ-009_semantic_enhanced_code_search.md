# User Journey: Semantic-Enhanced Code Search

### Basic Information
- **Journey ID**: UJ-009
- **Source**: DTNote01.md chunks 21-40 (lines 5981-12000)
- **Extraction Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Persona**: Senior Developer (Individual Contributor)
- **Workflow Type**: Development - Code Navigation

### Journey Details

#### Current State Analysis
**Current Pain Points**:
- ripgrep finds too many false positives when searching for function usage
- No understanding of semantic context in search results
- Manual filtering of results wastes significant time (often 60-80% of search time)
- Difficulty distinguishing between actual usage and string matches in comments/docs

**Current Workflow**:
Developer runs `rg "function_name"` → manually reviews hundreds of results → filters out false positives → navigates to relevant matches → repeats for related symbols

**Time Investment**:
15-30 minutes per complex search session, 3-5 sessions per day

#### Proposed Solution
**Solution Overview**:
Parseltongue-enhanced ripgrep that pre-filters results using ISG semantic understanding, providing only semantically relevant matches with context

**Key Parseltongue Features Utilized**:
- ISG semantic relationship analysis
- Symbol usage classification (definition, call, reference)
- Context-aware filtering based on code structure
- Integration with ripgrep's high-performance text search

**Integration Tools Required**:
- ripgrep (enhanced with parseltongue filter)
- parseltongue ISG analysis engine
- IDE extensions for seamless integration
- Command-line wrapper for terminal usage

#### Expected Outcomes

**Success Metrics**:
- 80% reduction in false positive search results
- 50% faster time to find relevant code sections
- 95% accuracy in semantic relevance of results
- Zero learning curve (uses familiar ripgrep interface)

**Business Value**:
- 40-60% improvement in code navigation efficiency
- Reduced developer frustration and context switching
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- Improved code comprehension and maintenance velocity

**Technical Benefits**:
- Semantic understanding of code relationships
- Automated result ranking by relevance
- Context-aware search that understands code structure
- Seamless integration with existing developer workflows

### Implementation Details

**Prerequisites**:
- Parseltongue ISG analysis for target codebase
- Enhanced ripgrep binary with parseltongue integration
- Optional IDE extension for enhanced UX
- Configuration for semantic filtering preferences

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Developer runs enhanced `rg "symbol_name"` command
2. Parseltongue ISG pre-filters results for semantic relevance
3. Ripgrep performs high-speed text search on filtered scope
4. Results returned with semantic context and relevance ranking
5. Developer navigates directly to meaningful matches

**Error Handling**:
- Fallback to standard ripgrep if ISG unavailable
- Progressive enhancement - works with partial semantic data
- Clear error messages for configuration issues

### Verification Questions
1. Can semantic filtering actually achieve 80% false positive reduction?
2. Will the integration maintain ripgrep's performance characteristics?
3. How does this handle edge cases like macros and generic code?

**Verification Answers**:
1. Yes - ISG can distinguish textual matches from semantic relationships, eliminating most comment/string false positives
2. Yes - semantic filtering reduces search scope, often improving overall performance
3. Parseltongue's AST-based analysis handles most Rust language constructs; fallback to text search for edge cases
