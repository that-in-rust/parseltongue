# UJ-034: Blast-Radius-Guided Quality Assurance

## Overview
**Persona**: DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer  
**Workflow Type**: Testing, Security  
**Source**: DTNote02.md - Automated Quality Gates via Blast-Radius Analysis  
**Strategic Theme**: Performance-First Architecture Culture, AI-Augmented Development Intelligence

## Current Pain Points
- Testing efforts spread thin across entire codebase without strategic focus
- Security analysis lacks prioritization on high-impact code areas
- Fuzzing targets chosen arbitrarily rather than based on risk assessment
- Limited resources for comprehensive quality assurance across large codebases
- No systematic approach to identify critical code paths for intensive testing

## Proposed Solution
Implement risk-prioritized testing and security analysis using Parseltongue's blast-radius analysis:

**Target Identification Process**:
1. Use `parseltongue query blast-radius <function>` to identify "High" or "Critical" impact functions
2. Extract function signatures and type definitions via `parseltongue generate-context`
3. Generate targeted test harnesses using LLM with verified context
4. Focus fuzzing, property-based testing, and security scans on high-risk areas

**Quality Assurance Workflows**:
- **Targeted Fuzzing**: "Budgeted fuzzing" runs (5-10 minutes) on high-impact functions using `cargo-fuzz`
- **Property-Based Testing**: Generate `proptest` strategies for critical public interfaces
- **Security Scanning**: Guide `CodeQL` analysis to focus on high-risk code paths
- **CVE Impact Analysis**: Trace vulnerability propagation through call chains

## Success Metrics
- **Bug Discovery Efficiency**: 4x faster critical bug discovery compared to unfocused testing
- **Resource Optimization**: Concentrated testing effort on 5% of code that represents 80% of risk
- **Security Coverage**: Improved detection of vulnerabilities in high-impact areas
- **CI Integration**: Automated quality gates based on risk assessment

## Integration Requirements
- **Testing Tools**: cargo-fuzz, proptest, CodeQL integration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated triggering based on blast-radius analysis
- **Risk Thresholds**: Configurable impact levels for different quality assurance activities
- **Reporting**: Clear visualization of risk-based testing coverage
- **Performance**: Fast analysis to enable real-time quality gate decisions

## Expected Outcomes
- Quality assurance resources focused on highest-impact code areas
- Faster discovery of critical bugs through targeted testing approaches
- Security analysis becomes more effective through risk-based prioritization
- Reduced overall testing time while maintaining or improving coverage quality
- Automated quality gates prevent high-risk changes without appropriate testing

## Implementation Notes
- Balance automation with human oversight for critical decisions
- Provide clear rationale for risk assessments and testing recommendations
- Support incremental analysis for continuous integration workflows
- Include comprehensive logging and audit trails for quality assurance decisions
- Ensure compatibility with existing testing and security toolchains
