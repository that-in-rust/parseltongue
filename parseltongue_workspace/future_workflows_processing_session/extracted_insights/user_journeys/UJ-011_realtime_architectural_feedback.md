# User Journey: Real-Time Architectural Feedback

### Basic Information
- **Journey ID**: UJ-011
- **Source**: DTNote01.md chunks 21-40 (lines 5981-12000)
- **Extraction Date**: 2025-09-26
- **Persona**: Team Lead (Technical Leadership)
- **Workflow Type**: Development - Architecture Governance

### Journey Details

#### Current State Analysis
**Current Pain Points**:
- Architectural violations discovered late in review process (often after significant development)
- No real-time feedback on design decisions during coding
- Difficulty maintaining architectural consistency across team members
- Manual enforcement of architectural patterns and constraints
- Knowledge silos where architectural understanding is concentrated in few team members

**Current Workflow**:
Developer codes → commits → PR review → architectural issues discovered → rework required → delayed delivery

**Time Investment**:
2-4 hours per architectural violation to identify and fix, 1-3 violations per week per team

#### Proposed Solution
**Solution Overview**:
IDE integration providing real-time architectural feedback as code is written, with proactive guidance and violation prevention

**Key Parseltongue Features Utilized**:
- Real-time ISG analysis during code editing
- Architectural pattern recognition and validation
- Dependency cycle detection and prevention
- Integration with LSP for seamless IDE experience

**Integration Tools Required**:
- LSP extension for real-time analysis
- Parseltongue daemon for continuous monitoring
- IDE notification system for feedback delivery
- Configuration system for architectural rules and patterns

#### Expected Outcomes

**Success Metrics**:
- 95% reduction in architectural violations reaching PR stage
- 30% improvement in code consistency metrics across team
- 50% reduction in architecture-related review cycles
- 80% faster resolution of architectural issues when they occur

**Business Value**:
- Dramatically reduced rework and technical debt
- Improved team productivity through proactive guidance
- Scalable architectural knowledge distribution
- Faster onboarding of new team members to architectural patterns

**Technical Benefits**:
- Proactive architectural guidance that prevents issues
- Real-time validation of design decisions
- Automated enforcement of team coding standards
- Context-aware suggestions for architectural improvements

### Implementation Details

**Prerequisites**:
- Parseltongue LSP sidecar service implementation
- IDE extension for architectural feedback display
- Configuration system for team-specific architectural rules
- Integration with existing rust-analyzer setup

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Developer writes code in IDE with parseltongue LSP extension
2. Real-time ISG analysis detects potential architectural issues
3. IDE displays contextual warnings, suggestions, or confirmations
4. Developer receives immediate feedback and can adjust approach
5. Code reaches PR stage with architectural compliance pre-validated

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful degradation if parseltongue service unavailable
- Configurable sensitivity levels for different types of feedback
- Override mechanisms for exceptional cases

### Verification Questions
1. Can real-time architectural analysis maintain IDE responsiveness (<50ms)?
2. Will developers find the feedback helpful rather than intrusive?
3. How does this handle complex architectural patterns that span multiple files?

**Verification Answers**:
1. Yes - parseltongue's efficient ISG enables fast lookups; incremental analysis minimizes computation
2. Yes - contextual, actionable feedback with configurable sensitivity prevents notification fatigue
3. Parseltongue's cross-file dependency analysis can validate multi-file patterns; progressive disclosure handles complexity
