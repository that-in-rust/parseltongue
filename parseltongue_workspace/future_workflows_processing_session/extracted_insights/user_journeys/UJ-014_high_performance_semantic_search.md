# UJ-014: High-Performance Semantic Code Search

## User Journey: High-Performance Code Search and Analysis

**Persona**: Senior Rust Developer
**Workflow Type**: Development and Architecture Analysis

## Current Pain Points
- Traditional grep/ripgrep tools provide text matches but lack semantic understanding
- IDE "find references" is slow and often inaccurate for complex Rust codebases  
- Developers spend 300,000x more time discovering entity names than executing queries
- AST-based tools like ast-grep are slow for large codebases
- Difficulty distinguishing between trait definitions and implementations
- Function calls vs. function definitions across modules create confusion

## Proposed Solution
Parseltongue's semantic search capabilities that understand Rust semantics, providing:
- Sub-millisecond semantic queries through ISG-based navigation
- Discovery-first architecture eliminating entity name bottlenecks
- Real-time file monitoring with <12ms update latency
- Zero hallucination context generation for AI tools
- Semantic understanding of Rust constructs (traits, impls, modules)

## Success Metrics
- **Query Performance**: Sub-millisecond query responses (vs. minutes of grepping)
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ relationship extraction accuracy
- **Real-time Updates**: <12ms file change processing for continuous development
- **Memory Efficiency**: <25MB memory usage for 100K LOC codebases
- **Developer Productivity**: 10x faster code navigation and architectural understanding

## Integration Tools
- **Search Tools**: ripgrep, ast-grep, tree-sitter
- **Development Environment**: IDE extensions, LSP integration
- **AI Tools**: Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- **Rust Ecosystem**: cargo, rustdoc, rust-analyzer

## Expected Outcomes
- **Immediate Impact**: 10x faster code navigation and entity discovery
- **Architectural Clarity**: Understand complex codebases in seconds vs. hours
- **AI Enhancement**: Zero hallucination context for AI-assisted development
- **Developer Experience**: Seamless integration into existing Rust workflows
- **Team Productivity**: Shared architectural understanding through semantic maps

## Implementation Requirements
- Interface Signature Graph (ISG) for semantic relationship mapping
- High-performance query engine with O(1) operations
- Real-time file monitoring and incremental updates
- Integration with existing Rust toolchain (cargo, rustdoc)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Source Traceability
- **DTNote01.md Lines**: 17981-24000 (Chunks 61-80)
- **Key Insights**: Performance optimization strategies, semantic vs. text search differentiation
- **Supporting Evidence**: ripgrep performance analysis, ast-grep optimization case studies
