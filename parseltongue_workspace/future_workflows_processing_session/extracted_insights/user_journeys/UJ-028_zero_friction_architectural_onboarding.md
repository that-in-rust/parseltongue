# UJ-028: Zero-Friction Architectural Onboarding

## User Journey Overview

**Journey Name**: Zero-Friction Architectural Onboarding
**Persona**: New Developer (joining large Rust codebase)
**Workflow Type**: Architecture Discovery and Understanding
**Priority**: Critical
**Implementation Timeline**: Foundation Phase (0-3 months)

## Current Pain Points

### Time-Intensive Code Reading
- **Problem**: Spending days or weeks reading code to understand system architecture
- **Impact**: Delayed productivity, frustrated developers, extended onboarding periods
- **Cost**: 5-20 hours per developer for basic architectural understanding
- **Frequency**: Every new hire, every project transition, every major refactoring

### Architectural Assumptions and Mistakes
- **Problem**: Making incorrect assumptions about system structure and relationships
- **Impact**: Introducing bugs, breaking existing functionality, technical debt accumulation
- **Cost**: Hours of debugging, code review overhead, production incidents
- **Frequency**: Multiple times per week for new team members

### Tribal Knowledge Dependency
- **Problem**: Relying on existing team members for architectural explanations
- **Impact**: Bottlenecks on senior developers, knowledge silos, inconsistent understanding
- **Cost**: Senior developer time diverted from high-value work
- **Frequency**: Continuous interruptions during onboarding period

### Incomplete Mental Models
- **Problem**: Building partial or incorrect mental models of system architecture
- **Impact**: Suboptimal design decisions, missed optimization opportunities, fear of making changes
- **Cost**: Reduced code quality, slower feature development, increased technical debt
- **Frequency**: Persistent throughout early tenure on project

## Proposed Solution

### Instant Architectural Intelligence Workflow

```bash
# Step 1: 5-second architectural clarity (vs 5 hours of reading)
parseltongue ingest codebase.dump

# Step 2: Understand key abstractions instantly
parseltongue query what-implements Service
parseltongue query what-implements Handler  
parseltongue query what-implements Repository

# Step 3: Visual architecture overview
parseltongue visualize --output architecture.html

# Step 4: Generate comprehensive context for specific modules
parseltongue generate-context MyModule --format json > context.json
parseltongue generate-context DatabaseLayer --format markdown > db_guide.md
```

### Interactive Discovery Process

#### Phase 1: High-Level Architecture (30 seconds)
```bash
# Discover main architectural patterns
parseltongue query list-traits | head -20
parseltongue query find-cycles --max-depth 3
parseltongue visualize --filter "core modules"
```

#### Phase 2: Domain Understanding (2 minutes)
```bash
# Understand specific domains
parseltongue query blast-radius UserService
parseltongue query what-calls authenticate
parseltongue generate-context AuthenticationFlow
```

#### Phase 3: Implementation Patterns (3 minutes)
```bash
# Learn implementation conventions
parseltongue query what-implements Error
parseltongue query what-implements Serialize
parseltongue query find-similar-functions handle_request
```
