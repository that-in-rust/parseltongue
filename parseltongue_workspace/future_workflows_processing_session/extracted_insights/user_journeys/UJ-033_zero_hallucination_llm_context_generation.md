# UJ-033: Zero-Hallucination LLM Context Generation

## Overview
**Persona**: Individual Developer, AI-Assisted Development  
**Workflow Type**: LLM Integration  
**Source**: DTNote02.md - Zero-Hallucination LLM Workflows via RAG & Prompt Kits  
**Strategic Theme**: AI-Augmented Development Intelligence, Performance-First Architecture Culture

## Current Pain Points
- LLMs hallucinate incorrect code relationships and non-existent functions
- Unstructured code context leads to poor AI suggestions and recommendations
- No verification mechanism for AI-generated code claims or architectural advice
- Developers cannot trust AI assistance for critical architectural decisions
- Context retrieval is imprecise, leading to irrelevant or misleading responses

## Proposed Solution
Implement a graph-verified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Parseltongue's Interface Signature Graphs:

**RAG Architecture Components**:
- **Knowledge Base**: Parseltongue's verified Interface Signature Graphs as structured knowledge
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Graph traversal for deep semantic understanding
- **Provenance Data**: Precise citations with repository URL, commit SHA, file path, line/column numbers
- **Context Objects**: Structured entities with relationships, metadata, and verification data
- **Null-Response Guardrails**: Return null when high-confidence information unavailable

**Integration Workflow**:
1. Use `parseltongue generate-context <entity>` for verified symbol summaries
2. Provide structured context objects with provenance to LLM
3. LLM operates on verified relationships rather than speculative code understanding
4. Include citation data for all claims and recommendations

## Success Metrics
- **Hallucination Reduction**: 41% fewer incorrect AI responses on SWE-bench benchmarks
- **Citation Accuracy**: 100% verifiable provenance for all context provided
- **Context Relevance**: Improved precision of retrieved information for queries
- **Developer Trust**: Increased confidence in AI-assisted development decisions

## Integration Requirements
- **LLM APIs**: Compatible with major language model providers
- **Context Format**: Structured JSON with entities, relationships, and metadata
- **Verification System**: AST-based validation of all provided context
- **Prompt Templates**: Optimized prompts that leverage structured context effectively
- **Benchmark Integration**: SWE-bench, RustEvo compatibility for evaluation

## Expected Outcomes
- Developers receive trustworthy AI assistance with verifiable context
- LLM suggestions are grounded in actual codebase reality rather than speculation
- Architectural advice includes precise citations and verification data
- Reduced time spent validating AI-generated code suggestions
- Enhanced productivity through reliable AI-assisted development

## Implementation Notes
- Prioritize precision over recall to maintain trust
- Implement comprehensive error handling for context generation failures
- Provide clear indicators when context is incomplete or uncertain
- Support incremental context building for complex queries
- Include performance optimization for real-time context generation
