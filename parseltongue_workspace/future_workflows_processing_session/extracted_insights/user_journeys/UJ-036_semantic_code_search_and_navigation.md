# User Journey: Semantic Code Search and Navigation

**ID**: UJ-036
**Source**: DTNotes03.md - Semantic Grep & Interactive ISG Explorer
**Persona**: Individual Developer, Team Lead
**Workflow Type**: Development, Architecture Analysis

## Current Pain Points
- Standard grep searches produce noisy results across entire codebase
- Developers waste time filtering irrelevant search results
- No way to restrict searches to specific architectural scopes
- Terminal-based code exploration lacks semantic understanding
- Context switching between analysis tools and code navigation

## Proposed Solution
Implement semantic search capabilities that restrict searches to specific architectural scopes:

**Semantic Grep**: Search within architectural boundaries (e.g., "Find `.unwrap()` calls only in functions impacted by the Router")
**Interactive ISG Explorer**: Terminal-based semantic navigation with fuzzy finding and contextual actions

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Semantic Grep - scope-aware searching
./pt-grep.sh impact Router ".unwrap()"  # Search within blast radius
./pt-grep.sh trait Display "impl"       # Search within trait implementations

# Interactive Explorer with fzf integration
./pt-explore.sh  # Fuzzy search entities with contextual actions
# [Enter] Open Definition | [Ctrl+C] Show Callers | [Ctrl+I] Show Impact
```

## Success Metrics
- **Search Precision**: 80% reduction in irrelevant search results
- **Navigation Speed**: 50% faster code exploration and entity discovery
- **Context Accuracy**: 95% of searches return architecturally relevant results
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Preferred over standard grep for architectural analysis

## Integration Requirements
- Parseltongue impact and query commands with `--format=files_only` flag
- ripgrep for high-performance text searching
- fzf for interactive fuzzy finding and selection
- Vim/editor integration for seamless code opening
- Configurable context line extraction

## Expected Outcomes
- Developers can search within specific architectural boundaries
- Faster identification of patterns within relevant code sections
- Reduced cognitive load from filtering irrelevant search results
- Enhanced terminal-based development workflow
- IDE-like semantic navigation in command-line environments

## Dependencies
- Parseltongue query system with file output formatting
- ripgrep installation
- fzf for interactive selection
- Shell scripting environment (bash)
- Text editor integration (vim, code, etc.)

## Priority
**High** - Significantly improves developer productivity in code exploration and analysis
