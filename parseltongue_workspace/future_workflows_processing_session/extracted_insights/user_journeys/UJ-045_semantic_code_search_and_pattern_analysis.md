# UJ-045: Semantic Code Search and Pattern Analysis

## Overview
Enable developers to query their codebase like a structured database using semantic properties and relationships rather than text patterns.

## User Journey Details

**Persona**: Senior Developer / Architect / Tech Lead
**Workflow Type**: Code Discovery / Architecture Analysis / Pattern Recognition
**Complexity**: Medium
**Frequency**: Daily development and architectural analysis

## Current Pain Points
- Text-based search (grep) lacks semantic understanding of code structure
- Difficulty finding code patterns based on architectural properties (return types, trait implementations)
- No way to compose complex queries about code relationships
- IDE "Find Usages" provides basic semantic awareness but lacks expressiveness
- Manual pattern analysis is time-intensive and error-prone

## Proposed Solution
Semantic Grep (pt sgrep) - a composable semantic query language that enables complex architectural questions through chained filters operating on ISG entities and relationships.

### Example Queries
- Find error handling patterns: `pt sgrep --returns "Result<_, _>" --calls-macro "log::error"`
- Debug serialization issues: `pt sgrep --impls-trait "serde::Serialize" --has-lifetime "'a"`
- Analyze public API: `pt sgrep --is-public --in-module "handlers"`
- Find async patterns: `pt sgrep --is-async --calls-function "tokio::spawn"`

## Success Metrics
- **Discovery Speed**: 80% faster architectural pattern discovery
- **Search Precision**: 95% more precise results compared to text-based search
- **Query Expressiveness**: Enable complex architectural queries impossible with existing tools
- **Pattern Analysis**: 60% faster codebase consistency analysis

## Integration Requirements

### Tools Required
- Parseltongue core engine (significant extension required)
- Query parser for composable filter chains
- LLM integration for pattern analysis and recommendations

### Technical Dependencies
- Extended query engine in src/discovery/engine.rs
- Complex predicate evaluation on ISG nodes and edges
- Composable filter chain processing
- Multiple output formats (JSON, text, visual)

## Expected Outcomes
- Evolution from text search to semantic database querying paradigm
- Enable architectural analysis through expressive query language
- Establish foundation for AI-powered pattern analysis and recommendations
- Transform code exploration from manual browsing to targeted querying

## Implementation Priority
**High** - Fundamental capability that enables advanced architectural analysis
