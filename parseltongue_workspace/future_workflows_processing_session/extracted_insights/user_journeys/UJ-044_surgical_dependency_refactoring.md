# UJ-044: Surgical Dependency Refactoring

## Overview
Provide surgical precision for managing third-party dependencies by mapping external dependency graphs to internal semantic usage patterns.

## User Journey Details

**Persona**: Security Engineer / Senior Developer / Platform Engineer
**Workflow Type**: Security / Dependency Management / Refactoring
**Complexity**: High
**Frequency**: Security vulnerability response, major dependency updates

## Current Pain Points
- Difficulty identifying exact usage sites of vulnerable or outdated dependencies
- Vague understanding of how external dependencies impact internal code architecture
- Manual dependency migration is error-prone and time-intensive
- Risk of missing dependency usage sites during security vulnerability remediation
- Lack of precise impact assessment for dependency changes

## Proposed Solution
Dependency Auditor that bridges external dependency graphs (cargo tree) with internal semantic usage (Parseltongue) to provide definitive answers about dependency usage and enable precise refactoring guidance.

### Workflow Steps
1. Use `cargo tree` to analyze dependency graph and identify usage paths
2. Query Parseltongue to find all `use` statements importing from target dependency
3. Trace internal usage with `pt debug` to find every function using imported entities
4. Generate comprehensive usage map with file locations and semantic context
5. Create targeted LLM prompts for precise dependency migration with full context

## Success Metrics
- **Speed**: 70% faster security vulnerability remediation through precise targeting
- **Accuracy**: 100% coverage of dependency usage sites with zero missed locations
- **Safety**: 90% reduction in breaking changes during dependency updates
- **Confidence**: Complete audit trail for dependency impact assessment

## Integration Requirements

### Tools Required
- cargo tree (external dependency graph analysis)
- Parseltongue (list-entities, where-defined, debug, generate-context)
- LLM integration (targeted refactoring guidance)

### Technical Dependencies
- Dependency graph parsing and analysis
- Import statement detection and mapping
- Semantic usage tracing through ISG
- Context-rich refactoring prompt generation

## Expected Outcomes
- Transform dependency management from guesswork to surgical precision
- Enable confident security vulnerability response with complete impact understanding
- Establish reliable patterns for large-scale dependency migrations
- Create link between package-level and code-level dependency understanding

## Implementation Priority
**High** - Critical for security response and major dependency management
