# User Journey: Compiler Error Resolution with Architectural Context

**ID**: UJ-038
**Source**: DTNotes03.md - Borrow Checker Whisperer
**Persona**: Individual Developer, Rust Developer
**Workflow Type**: Development, Debugging

## Current Pain Points
- Rust borrow checker errors lack architectural context
- Developers struggle to understand ownership issues in complex codebases
- Error messages don't explain the broader architectural implications
- LLMs provide generic solutions without understanding the specific architectural constraints
- Time-consuming trial-and-error approach to fixing ownership issues

## Proposed Solution
Implement "Borrow Checker Whisperer" that combines compiler error messages with architectural traces from Parseltongue:

- Capture structured compiler errors using `cargo check --message-format=json`
- Parse specific error types (e.g., E0502 - conflicting borrows)
- Generate architectural context for the affected entities
- Provide combined report with both compiler diagnostics and architectural understanding

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Automated borrow checker analysis with architectural context
./pt-borrow-fix.sh

# Workflow:
# 1. Run cargo check with JSON output
# 2. Parse errors using jq for specific error codes
# 3. Identify enclosing entities for each error location
# 4. Generate architectural traces using Parseltongue debug
# 5. Combine compiler errors with architectural context
```

## Success Metrics
- **Error Resolution Speed**: 60% faster resolution of borrow checker errors
- **Solution Quality**: 80% reduction in trial-and-error fixes
- **Architectural Understanding**: Developers understand ownership patterns in context
- **LLM Assistance Quality**: More accurate AI suggestions with architectural grounding

## Integration Requirements
- Cargo with JSON message format support
- jq for JSON parsing and error extraction
- Parseltongue debug functionality for architectural traces
- Entity identification at specific file locations
- Integration with development workflow and IDE

## Expected Outcomes
- Faster resolution of complex ownership issues
- Better understanding of architectural implications of ownership decisions
- More effective LLM assistance for Rust-specific problems
- Reduced frustration with borrow checker errors
- Improved code quality through architectural awareness

## Dependencies
- Rust toolchain with cargo
- jq for JSON processing
- Parseltongue debug and entity identification
- Shell scripting environment
- Enhanced entity location detection (future Parseltongue feature)

## Priority
**High** - Addresses major pain point in Rust development workflow
