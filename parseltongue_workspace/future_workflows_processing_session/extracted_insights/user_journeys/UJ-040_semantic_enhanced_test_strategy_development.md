# UJ-040: Semantic-Enhanced Test Strategy Development

## Overview
Transform reactive testing into proactive risk mitigation through semantic impact analysis combined with coverage data.

## User Journey Details

**Persona**: Senior Developer / Tech Lead
**Workflow Type**: Testing / Quality Assurance
**Complexity**: High
**Frequency**: Per feature development cycle

## Current Pain Points
- Coverage reports show what IS covered but not what SHOULD be covered next
- No connection between semantic impact analysis and test prioritization  
- Generic test generation requests to LLMs lack strategic context
- Manual risk assessment for test planning is time-intensive
- Difficulty identifying high-impact, untested code paths

## Proposed Solution
Test Oracle workflow that combines Parseltongue blast-radius analysis with grcov coverage data to identify high-risk, uncovered code paths, then generates strategic LLM prompts for targeted test development.

### Workflow Steps
1. Developer specifies target entity for proposed change (e.g., `pt test-oracle UserService`)
2. System performs blast-radius analysis to identify all semantically connected entities
3. Automated test suite runs with coverage instrumentation enabled
4. Coverage data processed and mapped to semantic entities
5. High-risk, uncovered entities identified and prioritized
6. Context-rich LLM prompts generated for strategic test development

## Success Metrics
- **Time Reduction**: 60% faster time from feature change to comprehensive test coverage
- **Quality Improvement**: 40% higher test quality through strategic prioritization
- **Risk Mitigation**: 70% decrease in production bugs in high-impact code paths
- **Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in manual test planning effort

## Integration Requirements

### Tools Required
- Parseltongue (blast-radius, generate-context commands)
- grcov (coverage data aggregation)
- cargo test (test execution with instrumentation)
- LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)

### Technical Dependencies
- Rust toolchain with coverage instrumentation support
- LCOV format parsing capabilities
- Semantic-to-coverage mapping algorithms
- Template-based prompt generation system

## Expected Outcomes
- Transform testing from reactive coverage measurement to proactive risk mitigation strategy
- Enable strategic AI partnerships for test development rather than generic code generation
- Establish testing workflows that understand architectural impact
- Create feedback loop between semantic analysis and quality assurance

## Implementation Priority
**High** - Addresses critical gap in connecting semantic understanding to quality processes
