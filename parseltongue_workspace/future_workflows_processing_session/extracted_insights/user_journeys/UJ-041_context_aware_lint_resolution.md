# UJ-041: Context-Aware Lint Resolution

## Overview
Elevate cargo clippy warnings from simple suggestions into rich, context-aware refactoring tasks by enriching lint outputs with architectural context.

## User Journey Details

**Persona**: Individual Developer / Senior Engineer
**Workflow Type**: Code Quality / Refactoring
**Complexity**: Medium
**Frequency**: Daily development workflow

## Current Pain Points
- Clippy warnings lack architectural context about impact of proposed changes
- LLM fixes may introduce breaking changes without caller awareness
- Manual impact analysis for each lint warning is time-intensive
- Difficulty distinguishing between safe internal refactoring and dangerous API changes
- Generic lint resolution lacks understanding of function dependencies

## Proposed Solution
Lint Alchemist that enriches clippy output with semantic context from Parseltongue, providing full caller analysis and architectural impact assessment for safe, intelligent refactoring.

### Workflow Steps
1. Execute `cargo clippy --message-format=json` to capture structured lint warnings
2. For each lint, use file/line information to identify containing semantic entity
3. Query Parseltongue for full architectural context (source code, signature, callers)
4. Generate comprehensive LLM prompt with lint + code + impact analysis
5. Receive architecturally-aware refactoring suggestions that maintain API compatibility

## Success Metrics
- **Safety Improvement**: 85% reduction in breaking changes from automated refactoring
- **Speed Enhancement**: 50% faster lint resolution with architectural awareness
- **Quality Increase**: 60% higher code quality through context-informed improvements
- **Developer Confidence**: 90% confidence in automated refactoring safety

## Integration Requirements

### Tools Required
- cargo clippy (structured lint output)
- Parseltongue (entities-in-file, generate-context, debug commands)
- LLM integration (context-aware refactoring prompts)

### Technical Dependencies
- JSON parsing for clippy output format
- Semantic entity identification algorithms
- Caller analysis and impact assessment
- Template-based prompt generation with architectural context

## Expected Outcomes
- Transform clippy from simple style-checker to architecturally-aware refactoring engine
- Enable safe automated refactoring with full understanding of change implications
- Establish pattern for enriching simple tool outputs with semantic intelligence
- Create developer confidence in AI-assisted refactoring through architectural grounding

## Implementation Priority
**High** - Directly impacts daily developer productivity and code quality
