# UJ-016: Performance-Aware Development Workflow

## User Journey Overview
**Persona**: Team Lead
**Workflow Type**: Development + Performance Monitoring
**Priority**: Medium
**Implementation Complexity**: Medium

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- No visibility into how code changes affect visualization performance
- Manual performance testing is time-consuming and inconsistent
- Difficult to establish performance budgets for visualization features
- Performance regressions discovered late in development cycle
- Lack of standardized performance metrics across team

### Current Workarounds
- Ad-hoc performance testing before major releases
- Subjective performance assessment ("feels slow")
- Reactive performance fixes after user complaints
- Manual performance profiling using browser dev tools

## Proposed Solution

### Core Functionality
Integrated performance monitoring that tracks visualization rendering metrics across development lifecycle, with automated alerts for performance regressions.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Performance Feedback**: IDE integration showing visualization performance impact during development
- **Automated Regression Detection**: CI/CD pipeline integration catching performance degradation before merge
- **Performance Budget Management**: Configurable thresholds with automated enforcement
- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Trend analysis and performance evolution over time

### Technical Implementation
- Performance Observer API integration for real-time metrics collection
- CI/CD hooks for automated performance testing on code changes
- Performance dashboard with team-wide visibility
- Configurable performance budgets with threshold-based alerting

## Success Metrics

### Performance Monitoring Targets
- **Detection Accuracy**: 99.9% accuracy in performance regression identification
- **Alert Latency**: <5 minutes from code change to performance alert
- **Test Execution Time**: <30 seconds for performance validation in CI/CD
- **Coverage**: 100% of visualization-affecting code changes monitored

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 95% of team leads actively use performance monitoring
- **Feedback Timeliness**: Real-time performance feedback (<100ms latency in IDE)
- **Regression Prevention**: 80% reduction in performance-related bugs reaching production
- **Development Velocity**: 60% improvement through early performance feedback

## Integration Requirements

### Development Environment Integration
- **IDE Extensions**: Real-time performance profiling and feedback
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit performance validation
- **Code Review Integration**: Performance impact analysis in pull requests
- **Local Development**: Performance monitoring during local testing

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- **Automated Testing**: Performance regression testing on every commit
- **Build Gates**: Performance budget enforcement preventing degraded builds
- **Deployment Validation**: Performance verification before production deployment
- **Rollback Triggers**: Automatic rollback on performance threshold violations

### Monitoring and Analytics
- **Performance Dashboards**: Team-wide visibility into performance trends
- **Alert Systems**: Configurable notifications for performance issues
- **Historical Analysis**: Long-term performance trend tracking
- **Comparative Analysis**: Performance comparison across branches and releases

## Expected Outcomes

### Proactive Performance Management
- **Early Detection**: Performance issues identified during development rather than production
