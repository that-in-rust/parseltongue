## 300-Line Chunking Methodology Validation

### Chunking Consistency Verification
**Methodology Applied**:
- 300-line increments with 20-line context overlap
- Systematic progression through DTNote01.md
- Single-chunk processing for shorter files (DTNote02, DTNotes03, DTNote04)

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ **Chunk Size Consistency**: All DTNote01.md chunks follow 300-line standard
- ✅ **Context Overlap**: 20-line overlap maintained between adjacent chunks
- ✅ **Sequential Coverage**: No gaps between chunk boundaries
- ✅ **Complete File Coverage**: Final chunk (181-188) covers remaining lines to end of file

### Context Continuity Verification
**Overlap Management**:
- Chunk 1: Lines 1-300
- Chunk 2: Lines 281-580 (20-line overlap with Chunk 1)
- Chunk 3: Lines 561-860 (20-line overlap with Chunk 2)
- [Pattern continues through all 188 chunks]

**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED - Context overlap preserved narrative continuity throughout
