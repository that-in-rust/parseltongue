**Sample Expert Engagement Quality:**
```
Technical Architect: "The semantic search pipeline represents a paradigm shift from naive text matching to AST-aware analysis..."

Skeptical Engineer Challenge: "These integrations create complex dependency chains. What happens when the daemon crashes? How do we handle version mismatches..."

Response Synthesis: "The experts acknowledge the complexity concerns but argue that the modular architecture allows graceful degradation..."
```
