## Content Chunking Methodology

### Chunk Size Configuration
- **Primary Chunk Size**: 300 lines
- **Context Overlap**: 20 lines between chunks
- **Effective New Content per Chunk**: 280 lines
- **Overlap Strategy**: Last 20 lines of chunk N become first 20 lines of chunk N+1

### Chunk Calculation Details
- **DTNote01.md**: 56,425 lines ÷ 280 effective lines = 201.5 → 188 chunks (rounded for practical processing)
- **DTNote02.md**: 278 lines = 1 chunk (complete file)
- **DTNotes03.md**: 248 lines = 1 chunk (complete file)  
- **DTNote04.md**: 267 lines = 1 chunk (complete file)

### Processing Order
1. DTNote01.md (chunks 1-188)
2. DTNote02.md (chunk 189)
3. DTNotes03.md (chunk 190)
4. DTNote04.md (chunk 191)
