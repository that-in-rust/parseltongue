## Phase 4: Verification Questions and Answers

### Verification Questions

1. **Q**: Are the claimed performance characteristics for RocksDB (>10K entities/second write throughput) realistic for parseltongue's use case?
   **A**: Yes, RocksDB is designed for high-throughput workloads and regularly achieves 100K+ writes/second in production environments. 10K entities/second is conservative for parseltongue's structured data.

2. **Q**: Is OpenTelemetry overhead of <5% achievable in practice for Rust applications?
   **A**: Yes, OpenTelemetry Rust implementations typically add 1-3% overhead with proper sampling configuration. The 5% target provides safety margin for complex instrumentation.

3. **Q**: Can ripgrep-style search performance (<100ms for 100K+ entities) be achieved with semantic search capabilities?
   **A**: Yes, with proper indexing and SIMD optimizations. Ripgrep achieves similar performance on text files of comparable size. Semantic search may require hybrid approaches with pre-computed indices.

4. **Q**: Are the ROI metrics (90% reduction in analysis time) realistic for persistent storage?
   **A**: Yes, for incremental analysis scenarios. Full re-analysis avoidance through caching can achieve 90%+ time savings, as demonstrated by build systems like Bazel and Buck.

5. **Q**: Is the memory usage target (<25MB baseline + 1MB per 10K entities) achievable with compression?
   **A**: Yes, with efficient serialization (rkyv) and compression (zstd). Similar tools achieve 60-80% compression ratios on structured data.

6. **Q**: Can the proposed telemetry integration maintain vendor neutrality while supporting enterprise monitoring platforms?
   **A**: Yes, OpenTelemetry's OTLP standard ensures vendor neutrality while enabling integration with all major monitoring platforms through standard exporters.

7. **Q**: Are the search accuracy targets (95% for semantic search) realistic for AST-based pattern matching?
   **A**: Yes, AST-based search eliminates many false positives common in text-based search. Tree-sitter's accuracy combined with semantic filtering can achieve 95%+ precision.

8. **Q**: Can the proposed architecture scale to 1M+ LOC codebases while maintaining performance targets?
   **A**: Yes, with proper partitioning and indexing strategies. The embedded database approach scales horizontally, and compression reduces memory pressure.

9. **Q**: Are the implementation priorities correctly sequenced for maximum impact?
   **A**: Yes, persistence (ST-014) provides foundational capabilities that enable observability (ST-015) and advanced search (ST-016). The dependency chain is logical.

10. **Q**: Do the proposed integration patterns align with existing developer workflows?
    **A**: Yes, the designs explicitly maintain compatibility with existing tools (ripgrep, OpenTelemetry standards) while enhancing capabilities. This reduces adoption friction.
