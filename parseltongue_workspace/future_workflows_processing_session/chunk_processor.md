## Processing Commands

### Read Chunk Command Template
```bash
# For DTNote01.md chunks
sed -n '[START_LINE],[END_LINE]p' DeepThinkAdvisory/DTNote01.md

# For complete files
cat DeepThinkAdvisory/[FILENAME]
```

### Chunk Processing Workflow

1. **Extract Chunk Content**
   ```bash
   sed -n '[START_LINE],[END_LINE]p' DeepThinkAdvisory/DTNote01.md > temp_chunk.md
   ```

2. **Apply Analysis Framework**
   - Use superintelligence prompt template
   - Activate expert council
   - Perform conceptual blending
   - Generate verification questions

3. **Document Insights**
   - Create user journey documents using template
   - Create technical insight documents using template  
   - Create strategic theme documents using template
   - Update progress log

4. **Update Tracking**
   - Mark chunk as completed in progress log
   - Update completion percentage
   - Record insights extracted count
   - Note any cross-references identified

## Quality Assurance Checklist

For each chunk, verify:
- [ ] Superintelligence framework fully applied
- [ ] Expert council activated (5 personas minimum)
- [ ] Conceptual blending performed (3 alternative approaches)
- [ ] Verification questions generated (5-10 questions)
- [ ] Verification questions answered with evidence
- [ ] User journeys extracted and categorized
- [ ] Technical insights documented with specifications
- [ ] Strategic themes identified with competitive analysis
- [ ] Cross-references noted for synthesis phase
- [ ] Source traceability maintained (file + line range)
- [ ] Progress log updated
- [ ] Templates properly filled out

## Cross-Reference Tracking

### User Journey Cross-References
- Track related journeys across different personas
- Identify workflow dependencies and sequences
- Note integration opportunities between journeys

### Technical Insight Cross-References  
- Link related technical approaches
- Identify architectural dependencies
- Note performance and security relationships

### Strategic Theme Cross-References
- Connect related competitive advantages
- Identify ecosystem positioning synergies
- Track ROI metric relationships

## Synthesis Preparation

### Content Organization
- Group user journeys by persona and workflow type
- Organize technical insights by domain and priority
- Structure strategic themes by competitive advantage
- Prepare cross-reference mapping for final document

### Quality Validation
- Verify complete coverage of all source material
- Ensure analytical consistency across all chunks
- Validate insight quality and actionability
- Confirm strategic coherence and market relevance
