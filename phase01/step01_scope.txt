Phase 01 Scope: ZIP to Database Storage

Core Functionality:
1. Command Line Interface
- Accept two required arguments:
  * --input-zip (-i): Absolute path to source ZIP file
  * --output-dir (-o): Absolute path for base output directory
- Optional flags:
  * --verbose (-v): Enable verbose logging
+- Additional runtime configuration:
+  * --workers (-w): Number of worker threads
+  * --buffer-size (-b): Streaming buffer size
+  * --shutdown-timeout (-s): Graceful shutdown timeout

2. Output Directory Structure
- Auto-create timestamped analysis directory:
  output_dir/
    └── {zip-name}-{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}/  # e.g., my-project-20240125143022/
        ├── db/                        # sled database files
        ├── logs/                      # operation logs
        └── metrics/                    # Runtime metrics and traces
            ├── tokio-console.log       # Tokio runtime metrics
            └── task-metrics.json       # Task performance data

3. ZIP Processing
- Validate input ZIP file exists and is readable
- Stream ZIP contents directly to database without extraction
- Handle common ZIP formats and encodings (UTF-8, Windows-1252)
- Track processing progress with progress bar
+- Implement streaming with backpressure
+- Concurrent entry processing with configurable workers
+- Adaptive buffer sizing based on system resources
+- CRC validation in parallel with processing

4. Database Storage
- Store ZIP contents in sled database under timestamped directory
- Database structure:
  * Key: file path relative to ZIP root
  * Value: file contents as bytes
- Maintain index of stored files
- Handle large files efficiently using streaming
+- Connection pooling with configurable pool size
+- Batched write operations for better throughput
+- Async transaction management
+- Priority-based operation scheduling

5. Error Handling & Logging
- Graceful error handling for common scenarios:
  * Invalid/corrupt ZIP files
  * Permission issues
  * Disk space constraints
- Log operations to:
  * Console (with colors for different levels)
  * logs/processing.log
+- Structured logging with trace contexts
+- Metric collection for performance analysis
+- Circuit breakers for failing operations
+- Graceful degradation under load

Technical Constraints:
- Use stable Rust only
- Minimal dependencies:
  * zip: ZIP file processing
  * sled: embedded database
  * clap: CLI argument parsing
  * anyhow: error handling
  * log + env_logger: logging
  * indicatif: progress bars
  * encoding_rs: character encoding
Additional dependencies:
+  * tokio: Async runtime
+  * tokio-util: Async utilities
+  * tokio-stream: Stream traits
+  * tracing: Advanced logging
+  * metrics: Runtime metrics

Non-Goals for Phase 01:
- No ZIP extraction functionality
- No code analysis
- No summary generation
- No dependency analysis
- No security scanning
+- No distributed processing
+- No persistent metrics storage
+- No runtime reconfiguration
