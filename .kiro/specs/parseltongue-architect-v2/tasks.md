## TDD Discipline Enforcement

**Every task follows STUB â†’ RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR:**

1. **STUB**: Write the test interface and expected behavior
2. **RED**: Run tests, verify they fail for the right reasons
3. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
4. **REFACTOR**: Optimize, clean up, improve without breaking tests

**Performance contracts are tested first:**
- Write performance tests before implementing functionality
- Use `std::time::Instant` for precise timing measurements
- Fail fast if performance contracts are violated
- Optimize only after correctness is established

**No implementation without tests:**
- Every public function has comprehensive test coverage
- Property-based tests validate invariants across input space
- Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests validate all timing contracts

This plan ensures that Parseltongue Architect v2.0 delivers a reliable, high-performance foundation for architectural intelligence while maintaining strict adherence to TDD principles and the 30-day delivery timeline.
