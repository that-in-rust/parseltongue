# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Parseltongue codebase has accumulated compilation issues due to content generation artifacts and experimental code that is preventing successful builds. This feature focuses on cleaning up the codebase to restore compilation and establish a maintainable foundation for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Parseltongue codebase to compile successfully, so that I can build and test the application without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `cargo build` THEN the system SHALL compile without any compilation errors
2. WHEN I run `cargo test` THEN the system SHALL execute all tests without compilation failures
3. WHEN I run `cargo clippy` THEN the system SHALL pass all linting checks without warnings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove generated content and experimental code, so that the codebase contains only intentional, production-ready code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the codebase THEN the system SHALL contain no auto-generated content that interferes with compilation
2. WHEN I review code files THEN the system SHALL have no experimental or placeholder code that causes build failures
3. WHEN I run static analysis THEN the system SHALL show no dead code or unused imports that clutter the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between core functionality and experimental features, so that I can maintain code quality while allowing innovation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experimental code is added THEN the system SHALL isolate it behind feature flags or in separate modules
2. WHEN core functionality is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL follow established architectural patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated validation of code quality, so that compilation issues are caught early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL validate compilation success through CI checks
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive build and test validation
3. WHEN code quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation guidance
