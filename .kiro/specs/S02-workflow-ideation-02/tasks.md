# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Locate and examine the ast-grep codebase documentation
  - Find the docs/ast-grep-ast-grep-8a5edab282632443.txt file referenced in requirements
  - Examine the file structure and content to understand the scope of analysis needed
  - Create a reading plan to process the content in 300-line increments with proper tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5_

- [ ] 2. Process first 300-line chunk of ast-grep documentation
  - Read lines 1-300 of the ast-grep documentation using the superintelligence analytical framework
  - Apply expert persona analysis (Technical Architect, Product Strategist, DevOps Engineer, Skeptical Engineer)
  - Extract user journeys, technical insights, and strategic themes from this section
  - Document findings with proper source line references for traceability
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [-] 3. Process second 300-line chunk of ast-grep documentation
  - Read lines 301-600 of the ast-grep documentation with analytical rigor
  - Continue extracting user journeys and categorizing by developer persona
  - Identify technical implementation details and integration patterns
  - Cross-reference findings with previous chunk for coherent workflow development
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

  - [ ] 4. Process third 300-line chunk of ast-grep documentation
    - Read lines 601-900 of the ast-grep documentation
    - Focus on strategic insights and competitive advantages
    - Extract performance benchmarks and validation criteria where mentioned
    - Document architectural patterns and design rationale
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Continue systematic processing of remaining documentation chunks
  - Process subsequent 300-line chunks until complete coverage of source material
  - Maintain consistent analytical framework application across all sections
  - Track progress and ensure no content is missed or duplicated
  - Build comprehensive collection of extracted insights organized by type and theme
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 6. Categorize and organize extracted user journeys
  - Group user journeys by developer persona (Individual Developer, Team Lead, DevOps Engineer, Platform Engineer)
  - Classify workflows by type (Development, CI/CD, Architecture Analysis, LLM Integration)
  - Document pain points, proposed solutions, and success metrics for each journey
  - Create cross-references between related journeys and integration opportunities
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 7. Synthesize strategic insights and technical specifications
  - Organize strategic insights by theme (Developer Productivity, AI Enhancement, Ecosystem Integration)
  - Document technical implementation details with architecture diagrams and performance requirements
  - Capture integration patterns, APIs, protocols, and security considerations
  - Link technical specifications to their corresponding user journeys and business outcomes
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive final strategic document
  - Write executive summary highlighting key strategic themes and competitive advantages
  - Organize user journeys with technical implementation details and success metrics
  - Prioritize workflows by impact potential and implementation complexity
  - Include source material traceability and verification of key claims
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 9. Perform quality assurance and verification
  - Verify complete coverage of all source material with no gaps
  - Cross-check extracted insights for consistency and accuracy
  - Apply the superintelligence framework's verification questions to validate key claims
  - Ensure final document meets the standard of "superintelligence-level analysis quality"
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 1.4, 1.5_
