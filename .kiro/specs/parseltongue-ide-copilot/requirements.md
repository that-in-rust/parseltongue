# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Parseltongue IDE Co-pilot transforms the developer experience by providing **real-time, deterministic architectural intelligence** directly within the IDE environment. Building on the foundation of the AIM Daemon, this system creates a seamless symbiotic relationship between developers, their IDE, and LLM assistants, eliminating the "Stochastic Fog" of probabilistic code analysis.

**Mission**: Enable the "Symbiotic Developer" workflow where LLM assistants receive live, deterministic architectural context from the IDE, transforming AI coding assistance from probabilistic guesswork to logical deduction based on factual architectural state.

**Core Constraints:**
- **Real-Time Integration**: Sub-100ms response time for IDE queries during active development
- **Zero-Hallucination Context**: LLM assistants receive only verified, deterministic architectural facts
- **Seamless UX**: Invisible background operation with instant architectural awareness
- **Live State Synchronization**: Perfect consistency between code changes and architectural graph

## Requirements

### REQ-IDE-001.0: VS Code Extension Integration

**User Story:** As a Rust developer using VS Code, I want seamless Parseltongue integration that automatically starts the daemon and provides architectural intelligence without manual setup, so that I can focus on coding while having instant access to architectural insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN I save any .rs file THEN the extension SHALL receive real-time updates from the daemon within 12ms
4. WHEN the daemon encounters errors THEN the extension SHALL show non-intrusive notifications with actionable error messages
5. WHEN I close the workspace THEN the extension SHALL gracefully shut down the daemon and clean up resources
6. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL require zero configuration for standard Rust projects with Cargo.toml

### REQ-IDE-002.0: Contextual Code Intelligence

5. WHEN viewing blast radius THEN the IDE SHALL display results in a dedicated panel with expandable tree view
6. WHEN architectural relationships change THEN the IDE SHALL update all displayed information within 100ms

### REQ-IDE-003.0: Real-Time LLM Context Generation

**User Story:** As a developer using AI coding assistants, I want my LLM to receive live, deterministic architectural context so that it provides accurate, architecturally-aware suggestions instead of probabilistic guesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I invoke an LLM assistant (Copilot, Codeium, etc.) THEN the extension SHALL automatically inject current architectural context for the active file
2. WHEN generating context THEN the system SHALL include function signatures, trait bounds, and dependency relationships within 2 hops of the current entity
3. WHEN the LLM requests architectural information THEN the extension SHALL provide deterministic facts from the live ISG, not cached or stale data
4. WHEN context is injected THEN it SHALL be formatted as structured metadata that doesn't interfere with the user's prompt
5. WHEN architectural state changes THEN the extension SHALL invalidate cached context and regenerate on next LLM interaction
6. WHEN context generation fails THEN the extension SHALL gracefully degrade to normal LLM operation without blocking the user

### REQ-IDE-004.0: Interactive Architectural Exploration

**User Story:** As a Rust developer exploring unfamiliar codebases, I want interactive architectural navigation tools so that I can quickly understand complex systems and their relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use Ctrl+Shift+P and type "Parseltongue" THEN the IDE SHALL show commands for "Find Implementations", "Show Callers", "Analyze Blast Radius", and "Generate Architecture Map"
2. WHEN I execute "Find Implementations" THEN the IDE SHALL open a searchable list of all types implementing the selected trait
3. WHEN I execute "Show Callers" THEN the IDE SHALL display a tree view of all functions that call the selected function, with navigation links
4. WHEN I execute "Analyze Blast Radius" THEN the IDE SHALL show an interactive visualization of all entities affected by changes to the selected entity
5. WHEN I execute "Generate Architecture Map" THEN the IDE SHALL create a Mermaid diagram of the current module's architectural relationships
6. WHEN navigating results THEN clicking any entity SHALL jump to its definition and update the architectural context

### REQ-IDE-005.0: Live Debugging and Error Analysis

**User Story:** As a Rust developer debugging complex trait bound errors, I want architectural intelligence to help me understand and resolve compilation errors quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Rust compiler reports trait bound errors THEN the extension SHALL analyze the error using ISG data and suggest specific fixes
2. WHEN I encounter "trait bound not satisfied" errors THEN the extension SHALL show which traits are actually implemented and what's missing
3. WHEN debugging complex generic constraints THEN the extension SHALL display the full trait hierarchy and bounds in a readable format
4. WHEN I have orphan rule violations THEN the extension SHALL identify the conflicting implementations and suggest resolution strategies
5. WHEN compilation fails due to missing dependencies THEN the extension SHALL show the dependency chain and suggest where to add the missing trait bounds
6. WHEN error analysis completes THEN the extension SHALL provide actionable suggestions with code snippets for common fixes

### REQ-IDE-006.0: Architectural Diff and Change Impact

**User Story:** As a Rust developer making architectural changes, I want to see the impact of my modifications in real-time so that I can make informed decisions about code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify a trait definition THEN the IDE SHALL immediately show all affected implementations and their blast radius
2. WHEN I change function signatures THEN the extension SHALL highlight all call sites that need updates
3. WHEN I add or remove dependencies THEN the IDE SHALL show the architectural diff in a dedicated panel
