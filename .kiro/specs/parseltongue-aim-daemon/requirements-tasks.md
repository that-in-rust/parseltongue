- [ ] All requirements align with core constraints (Rust-only, <12ms, LLM-terminal)

### Design Quality Gate
**Criteria for moving to Implementation phase:**
- [ ] Technical architecture addresses all requirements
- [ ] API specifications are complete and consistent
- [ ] Performance design meets all latency and throughput targets
- [ ] Concurrency and thread safety design is sound
- [ ] Error handling and resilience design is comprehensive

### Implementation Quality Gate

- [ ] Performance targets are met in benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling works as specified
- [ ] API is stable and documented
- [ ] System is production-ready for initial users

## Risk Tracking

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Performance Targets**: <12ms update latency may be challenging with complex Rust parsing
2. **Memory Management**: Keeping 500K LOC graphs under memory limits
3. **Concurrency**: Thread-safe graph updates without performance degradation
4. **Rust Complexity**: Handling all edge cases in Rust's type system

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Incremental optimization, profiling-driven development
2. **Memory**: Efficient data structures, compression algorithms
3. **Concurrency**: Lock-free data structures where possible, careful lock ordering
4. **Complexity**: Phased approach (80% syn parsing, 20% compiler assistance)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. **Execute Task 0**: Systematically analyze all reference documents (24 files)
2. **Extract relevant ideas**: Focus on Rust-only, high-speed, LLM-terminal constraints
3. **Enrich requirements**: Add specific technical details and patterns found in documents

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
1. Complete all requirements refinement tasks (Tasks 1-6)
2. Conduct comprehensive requirements review
3. Begin technical architecture specification (Task 7)

### Medium Term (After Requirements Lock)
1. Complete API specification (Task 8)
2. Develop implementation plan (Task 9)
3. Begin MVP development

This task tracking ensures systematic progression through requirements refinement while maintaining focus on our core constraints and quality standards.
