# Parseltongue AIM Daemon - MVP 1.0 Requirements & Tasks

## MVP 1.0 Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Build the simplest possible system that delivers core value - fast, accurate Rust architectural intelligence for LLM integration.

### What MVP 1.0 IS
- ✅ **Rust-only focus**: Parse .rs files exclusively with `syn` crate
- ✅ **High-speed updates**: <12ms from file save to query readiness
- ✅ **LLM-terminal integration**: Deterministic architectural context generation
- ✅ **SQLite storage**: Proven, simple, meets performance requirements
- ✅ **Core queries**: who-implements, blast-radius, find-cycles, generate-context
- ✅ **Essential patterns**: 80% coverage with pure `syn` parsing

### What MVP 1.0 IS NOT
- ❌ **Multi-language support**: No JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.
- ❌ **Advanced graph databases**: No MemGraph, SurrealDB, TigerGraph
- ❌ **Complex coordination**: No Redis, message queues, microservices
- ❌ **ML/AI features**: No vector embeddings, fuzzy matching, probabilistic analysis
- ❌ **Enterprise features**: No distributed analysis, advanced security, complex workflows

### Backlog Strategy
**Aggressive backlog management**: Any feature that doesn't directly support the three core constraints (Rust-only, <12ms, LLM-terminal) gets moved to backlog immediately. This keeps MVP focused and deliverable.

## Current Status

### Requirements Document
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - 18 MVP requirements with detailed EARS acceptance criteria
- **Coverage**: Core functionality, performance targets, error handling, basic scalability
- **Quality**: All requirements are specific, measurable, and testable
- **Advanced Features**: Requirements 19-24 moved to [backlog.md](./backlog.md)

### Document Analysis Progress
- **_refDocs Completed**: 18/18 documents analyzed (100% complete this session)
- **_refIdioms Remaining**: 0/24 documents analyzed (0% complete)
- **Status**: 🟡 **PARTIAL COMPLETION** - Only _refDocs analyzed, _refIdioms directory not yet processed
- **Strategy**: Extract only ideas that align with MVP constraints (Rust-only, <12ms, LLM-terminal)
- **Process**: wc count → read 1000 lines at a time → extract MVP-relevant ideas → move advanced concepts to backlog
- **Next**: Need to analyze _refIdioms documents to complete Task 1

### Key Findings from Completed Analysis
**MVP-Relevant Concepts Extracted:**
- **Hybrid Storage Architecture**: DashMap + SQLite with specific performance optimizations
- **3-12ms Update Pipeline**: Detailed technical implementation with millisecond breakdown
- **SigHash Implementation**: Blake3-based content addressing for deterministic node identification
- **CLI Command Structure**: `parseltongue speak/ask/feed-llm` with specific query types
- **Performance Targets**: Validated <12ms updates, <500μs queries, <25MB memory for 100K LOC
- **80/20 Implementation Strategy**: 80% coverage with syn parsing, 20% compiler assistance
- **Core Query Types**: blast-radius, what-implements, find-cycles, generate-context
- **Anti-coordination Principles**: Simple SQLite approach validated over complex systems

## Backlog Management Strategy

### Immediate Backlog (Post-MVP)
**Version 1.5 Features** (3-6 months post-MVP):
- In-memory caching layer for hot queries
- Advanced Rust pattern recognition (macros, lifetimes)
- Enhanced error recovery and resilience
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### Medium-term Backlog
**Version 2.0 Features** (6-12 months post-MVP):
- Multi-workspace and cargo workspace support
- Advanced architectural pattern detection
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis
- CI/CD integration and automation

### Long-term Backlog
**Version 3.0+ Features** (12+ months post-MVP):
- Graph database migration (MemGraph/SurrealDB)
- Distributed codebase analysis
- Enterprise security and access control
- Advanced LLM integration patterns

### Backlog Decision Framework
**Move to backlog if**:
1. Doesn't directly support Rust-only constraint
2. Would compromise <12ms update performance
3. Adds complexity without clear LLM-terminal value
4. Requires technologies beyond SQLite + Rust ecosystem
5. Serves enterprise needs beyond MVP scope

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas for MVP
1. **Performance Targets**: <12ms may be challenging with complex parsing
2. **Memory Management**: Keeping large graphs under memory limits
3. **Rust Complexity**: Handling edge cases in type system
4. **Concurrency**: Thread-safe updates without performance loss

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize incrementally, use benchmarks
2. **Memory**: Efficient data structures, lazy loading, compression
3. **Complexity**: 80/20 rule - handle common cases first, edge cases later
4. **Concurrency**: Simple patterns (Arc<RwLock<T>>), avoid complex coordination

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
1. 🟡 **Task 1 PARTIAL**: _refDocs completed (18/18), _refIdioms remaining (0/24)
2. **Execute Task 2**: Quality assurance review of all 18 requirements (NEXT PRIORITY)
3. **Prepare for Phase 2**: Set up design document structure

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Complete technical architecture design (Task 3)
2. Complete API specification design (Task 4)
3. Begin implementation planning (Task 5)

### Medium Term (Next 3-5 Sessions)
1. Finalize implementation task breakdown
2. Begin MVP development with first implementation tasks
3. Set up testing and benchmarking infrastructure

## Success Metrics Dashboard

### Requirements Phase (Current)
- ✅ **Requirements Document**: 18/18 complete with EARS format
- 🟡 **Document Analysis**: 18/42 documents analyzed (43% complete) - _refDocs done, _refIdioms remaining
- 🔴 **Quality Assurance**: Not started
- 🔴 **Design Document**: Not started

### Overall MVP Progress
- **Requirements**: 70% complete (Task 1 partial, Task 2 not started)
- **Design**: 0% complete  
- **Implementation Planning**: 0% complete
- **Implementation**: 0% complete

**Target MVP Completion**: 6-8 weeks from requirements finalization

This revamped task structure maintains laser focus on MVP 1.0 delivery while ensuring no valuable ideas are lost to the backlog. The aggressive backlog strategy prevents scope creep while the systematic approach ensures quality and completeness.
