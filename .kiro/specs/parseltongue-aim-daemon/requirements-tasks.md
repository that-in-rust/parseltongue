# Parseltongue AIM Daemon - MVP 1.0 Requirements & Tasks

## MVP 1.0 Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Build the simplest possible system that delivers core value - fast, accurate Rust architectural intelligence for LLM integration.

### What MVP 1.0 IS
- ✅ **Rust-only focus**: Parse .rs files exclusively with `syn` crate
- ✅ **High-speed updates**: <12ms from file save to query readiness
- ✅ **LLM-terminal integration**: Deterministic architectural context generation
- ✅ **SQLite storage**: Proven, simple, meets performance requirements
- ✅ **Core queries**: who-implements, blast-radius, find-cycles, generate-context
- ✅ **Essential patterns**: 80% coverage with pure `syn` parsing

### What MVP 1.0 IS NOT
- ❌ **Multi-language support**: No JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.
- ❌ **Advanced graph databases**: No MemGraph, SurrealDB, TigerGraph
- ❌ **Complex coordination**: No Redis, message queues, microservices
- ❌ **ML/AI features**: No vector embeddings, fuzzy matching, probabilistic analysis
- ❌ **Enterprise features**: No distributed analysis, advanced security, complex workflows

### Backlog Strategy
**Aggressive backlog management**: Any feature that doesn't directly support the three core constraints (Rust-only, <12ms, LLM-terminal) gets moved to backlog immediately. This keeps MVP focused and deliverable.

## Current Status

### Requirements Document
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - 18 MVP requirements with detailed EARS acceptance criteria
- **Coverage**: Core functionality, performance targets, error handling, basic scalability
- **Quality**: All requirements are specific, measurable, and testable
- **Advanced Features**: Requirements 19-24 moved to [backlog.md](./backlog.md)

### Document Analysis Progress
- **Completed**: 11/29 reference documents analyzed (previous session)
- **Remaining**: 18 documents to analyze with systematic approach
- **Strategy**: Extract only ideas that align with MVP constraints (Rust-only, <12ms, LLM-terminal)
- **Process**: wc count → read 1000 lines at a time → extract MVP-relevant ideas → move advanced concepts to backlog
- **Decision Protocol**: When in doubt about inclusion, ask user for guidance

## Backlog Management Strategy

### Immediate Backlog (Post-MVP)
**Version 1.5 Features** (3-6 months post-MVP):
- In-memory caching layer for hot queries
- Advanced Rust pattern recognition (macros, lifetimes)
- Enhanced error recovery and resilience
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### Medium-term Backlog
**Version 2.0 Features** (6-12 months post-MVP):
- Multi-workspace and cargo workspace support
- Advanced architectural pattern detection
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis
- CI/CD integration and automation

### Long-term Backlog
**Version 3.0+ Features** (12+ months post-MVP):
- Graph database migration (MemGraph/SurrealDB)
- Distributed codebase analysis
- Enterprise security and access control
- Advanced LLM integration patterns

### Backlog Decision Framework
**Move to backlog if**:
1. Doesn't directly support Rust-only constraint
2. Would compromise <12ms update performance
3. Adds complexity without clear LLM-terminal value
4. Requires technologies beyond SQLite + Rust ecosystem
5. Serves enterprise needs beyond MVP scope

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas for MVP
1. **Performance Targets**: <12ms may be challenging with complex parsing
2. **Memory Management**: Keeping large graphs under memory limits
3. **Rust Complexity**: Handling edge cases in type system
4. **Concurrency**: Thread-safe updates without performance loss

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize incrementally, use benchmarks
2. **Memory**: Efficient data structures, lazy loading, compression
3. **Complexity**: 80/20 rule - handle common cases first, edge cases later
4. **Concurrency**: Simple patterns (Arc<RwLock<T>>), avoid complex coordination

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete Task 1**: Finish analyzing remaining 18 reference documents using systematic approach
2. **Execute Task 2**: Quality assurance review of all 18 requirements
3. **Prepare for Phase 2**: Set up design document structure

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Complete technical architecture design (Task 3)
2. Complete API specification design (Task 4)
3. Begin implementation planning (Task 5)

### Medium Term (Next 3-5 Sessions)
1. Finalize implementation task breakdown
2. Begin MVP development with first implementation tasks
3. Set up testing and benchmarking infrastructure
