# Development Methodology Steering Options

## Purpose
This document captures software development methodologies, architectural patterns, and implementation strategies discovered during document analysis that can guide the Parseltongue AIM Daemon development approach.

## Core Development Principles

### TDD-First Approach
- **Compile-time validation**: Use Rust's type system to catch errors at compile time
- **Property-based testing**: Leverage proptest for comprehensive test coverage
- **Test-driven design**: Write tests before implementation to drive API design
- **One-shot correctness**: Aim for implementations that work correctly on first compile

### Pure Function Architecture
- **Functional decomposition**: Break complex operations into pure, testable functions
- **Immutable data structures**: Prefer immutable types where performance allows
- **Side-effect isolation**: Separate pure logic from I/O and state mutations
- **Composable operations**: Design functions that can be easily combined and reused

### Rust-Specific Patterns
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Use Rust's type system for performance without runtime overhead
- **Ownership-driven design**: Let Rust's ownership model guide architectural decisions
- **Error propagation**: Use Result<T, E> and ? operator for clean error handling
- **Async patterns**: Structure concurrency with async/await and proper task management

## Implementation Strategies

### Incremental Development
- **Start with types**: Define data structures and interfaces first
- **Build from core**: Implement fundamental operations before complex features
- **Test at boundaries**: Focus testing on module interfaces and error conditions
- **Refactor fearlessly**: Use Rust's compiler to ensure refactoring safety

### Performance-First Design
- **Measure early**: Profile and benchmark from the beginning
- **Optimize hot paths**: Identify and optimize critical performance bottlenecks
- **Memory efficiency**: Design data structures for minimal memory footprint
- **Concurrent safety**: Use Arc<RwLock<T>> and DashMap for thread-safe operations

### Anti-Coordination Patterns
- **Direct function calls**: Avoid complex messaging or event systems
- **Simple state management**: Use straightforward data structures over complex patterns
- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer standard library and essential crates only
- **Explicit over implicit**: Make dependencies and relationships clear in code

## Decision Framework

### When to Apply TDD
- **New algorithms**: Complex parsing or graph traversal logic
- **Critical paths**: Performance-sensitive operations like SigHash generation
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive coverage of failure scenarios
- **API boundaries**: Public interfaces that other components depend on

### When to Use Pure Functions
- **Data transformations**: Converting between different data representations
- **Calculations**: Mathematical operations and algorithmic computations
- **Validation logic**: Input validation and constraint checking
- **Query operations**: Read-only operations on data structures

### When to Optimize
- **After correctness**: Only optimize working, tested code
- **Measured bottlenecks**: Use profiling to identify actual performance issues
- **Critical constraints**: Operations that must meet <12ms update targets
- **Memory pressure**: When approaching memory usage limits

## Architectural Patterns

### Layered Architecture
```
CLI Layer (clap commands)
    ↓
Service Layer (business logic)
    ↓
Repository Layer (data access)
    ↓
Storage Layer (SQLite + DashMap)
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```rust
// Library errors: thiserror for structured error types
// Application errors: anyhow for context and error chains
// Recovery: Graceful degradation with fallback strategies
```

### Concurrency Model
```rust
// File monitoring: notify crate with crossbeam channels
// Graph updates: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<SigHash, Node>>>
// Query serving: DashMap for lock-free concurrent access
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **Module structure**: Organize by domain (parsing, graph, storage, cli)
- **Interface segregation**: Small, focused traits and interfaces
- **Dependency injection**: Use trait objects for testability
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration with validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Property tests**: Use proptest for edge case discovery
- **Performance tests**: Benchmark critical operations

### Documentation Approach
- **Code comments**: Explain why, not what
- **API documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc for public interfaces
- **Architecture docs**: High-level design decisions and trade-offs
- **Usage examples**: Practical examples for common use cases
