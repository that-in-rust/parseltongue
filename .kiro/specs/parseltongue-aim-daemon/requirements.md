# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Parseltongue AIM Daemon is a **Rust-only** development tool that transforms code analysis from probabilistic text searches to deterministic, graph-based architectural navigation.

**Core MVP Constraints:**
- **Rust-Only Focus**: Exclusively designed for Rust codebases using `syn` crate for high-fidelity parsing
- **High-Speed Updates**: Interface graph updates must complete in <12ms for real-time development workflow
- **LLM-Terminal Integration**: Optimized for LLMs querying from terminal during active development sessions
