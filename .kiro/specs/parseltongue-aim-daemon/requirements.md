# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Parseltongue AIM Daemon is a revolutionary **Rust-only** development tool that transforms code analysis from probabilistic text searches to deterministic, graph-based architectural navigation. The system creates Interface Signature Graphs (ISG) exclusively from Rust codebases, enabling sub-millisecond queries, real-time architectural awareness, and zero-hallucination LLM context generation. The daemon provides developers with factual dependency analysis, blast-radius impact assessment, and constraint-aware AI assistance through compressed architectural intelligence.

- **Rust-Only Focus**: Exclusively designed for Rust codebases using `syn` crate for high-fidelity parsing
- **High-Speed Updates**: Interface graph updates must complete in <12ms for real-time development workflow
