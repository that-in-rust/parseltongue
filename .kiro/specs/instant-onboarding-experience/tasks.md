## Implementation Notes

### Test-Driven Development Approach
1. **STUB**: Write failing test that defines expected behavior
2. **RED**: Run test to confirm it fails for the right reason
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
4. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Incremental Integration Strategy
- Each task builds on previous tasks without breaking existing functionality
- Integration points are tested at each step
- Rollback capability maintained throughout development
- User-facing features are demonstrated as soon as they're functional

### Quality Gates
- No task is considered complete until all tests pass
- Performance contracts must be validated with automated tests
- User experience must be validated with manual testing
- Documentation must be updated to reflect new functionality

This implementation plan ensures systematic development of the instant onboarding experience while maintaining high quality standards and user-focused outcomes.
