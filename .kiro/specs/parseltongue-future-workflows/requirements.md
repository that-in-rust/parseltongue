# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically extracting and documenting comprehensive future parseltongue workflows from the DeepThink Advisory notes. The goal is to create a thorough collection of user journeys, insights, and strategic workflows by methodically reading through the advisory notes 300 lines at a time, ensuring no valuable insights are missed in creating the definitive future workflows document.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a technical strategist, I want to systematically read through the DeepThink Advisory notes in manageable chunks, so that I can extract every valuable insight and user journey without missing critical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the advisory notes THEN the system SHALL process them in 300-line increments to ensure thorough analysis
2. WHEN encountering a user journey THEN it SHALL be captured with full context including the problem, solution, and expected outcomes
3. WHEN finding technical insights THEN they SHALL be documented with their strategic implications and implementation details
4. IF multiple notes contain related concepts THEN they SHALL be cross-referenced and synthesized into coherent workflows
5. WHEN completing each 300-line section THEN progress SHALL be tracked to ensure complete coverage of all source material

### Requirement 2: User Journey Collection and Categorization

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want all user journeys from the DeepThink notes organized by persona and use case, so that I can understand the complete scope of parseltongue's potential impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting user journeys THEN they SHALL be categorized by developer persona (e.g., individual developer, team lead, DevOps engineer, platform engineer)
2. WHEN documenting workflows THEN each SHALL include the user's goal, current pain points, proposed solution, and success metrics
3. WHEN identifying integration opportunities THEN they SHALL specify the tools involved and the expected synergies
4. IF performance metrics are mentioned THEN they SHALL be captured with specific benchmarks and validation criteria
5. WHEN organizing journeys THEN they SHALL be grouped by workflow type (e.g., development, CI/CD, architecture analysis, LLM integration)

### Requirement 3: Strategic Insight Synthesis

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want the strategic insights from all DeepThink notes synthesized into actionable recommendations, so that I can understand the full vision for parseltongue's evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing strategic content THEN key innovations SHALL be identified and their competitive advantages documented
2. WHEN finding architectural patterns THEN they SHALL be captured with their design rationale and implementation approach
3. WHEN encountering integration strategies THEN they SHALL include the ecosystem positioning and adoption pathways
4. IF ROI metrics are provided THEN they SHALL be documented with their measurement methodology and expected outcomes
5. WHEN synthesizing insights THEN they SHALL be organized by strategic theme (e.g., developer productivity, AI enhancement, ecosystem integration)

### Requirement 4: Technical Implementation Details Capture

**User Story:** As a senior engineer, I want detailed technical specifications extracted from the advisory notes, so that I can understand the implementation requirements for each proposed workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting technical solutions THEN they SHALL include architecture diagrams, technology stack choices, and performance requirements
2. WHEN capturing integration patterns THEN they SHALL specify APIs, protocols, and data formats required
3. WHEN finding performance benchmarks THEN they SHALL be documented with test conditions and validation methods
4. IF security considerations are mentioned THEN they SHALL be captured with threat models and mitigation strategies
5. WHEN extracting technical details THEN they SHALL be linked to their corresponding user journeys and business outcomes

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Final Document Generation

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a comprehensive final document that consolidates all extracted insights into a coherent vision for parseltongue's future, so that I can understand the complete strategic roadmap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the final document THEN it SHALL include an executive summary with key strategic themes
2. WHEN organizing content THEN user journeys SHALL be presented with their technical implementation details and success metrics
3. WHEN presenting workflows THEN they SHALL be prioritized by impact potential and implementation complexity
4. IF integration opportunities exist THEN they SHALL be mapped to ecosystem positioning and adoption strategies
5. WHEN completing the document THEN it SHALL serve as a definitive guide for parseltongue's evolution with Shreyas-level depth and insight
