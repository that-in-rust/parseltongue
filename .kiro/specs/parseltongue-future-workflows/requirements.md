# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically extracting and documenting comprehensive future parseltongue workflows from the DeepThink Advisory notes. The goal is to create a thorough collection of user journeys, insights, and strategic workflows by methodically reading through the advisory notes 300 lines at a time, ensuring no valuable insights are missed in creating the definitive future workflows document.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Content Extraction

**User Story:** As a technical strategist, I want to systematically read through the DeepThink Advisory notes in manageable chunks, so that I can extract every valuable insight and user journey without missing critical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading the advisory notes THEN the system SHALL process them in 300-line increments to ensure thorough analysis
2. WHEN encountering a user journey THEN it SHALL be captured with full context including the problem, solution, and expected outcomes
3. WHEN finding technical insights THEN they SHALL be documented with their strategic implications and implementation details
4. IF multiple notes contain related concepts THEN they SHALL be cross-referenced and synthesized into coherent workflows

5. WHEN extracting technical details THEN they SHALL be linked to their corresponding user journeys and business outcomes

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Final Document Generation

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a comprehensive final document that consolidates all extracted insights into a coherent vision for parseltongue's future, so that I can understand the complete strategic roadmap.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the final document THEN it SHALL include an executive summary with key strategic themes
2. WHEN organizing content THEN user journeys SHALL be presented with their technical implementation details and success metrics
3. WHEN presenting workflows THEN they SHALL be prioritized by impact potential and implementation complexity
4. IF integration opportunities exist THEN they SHALL be mapped to ecosystem positioning and adoption strategies
5. WHEN completing the document THEN it SHALL serve as a definitive guide for parseltongue's evolution with Shreyas-level depth and insight

### Requirement 6: Supporting Analysis Framework

**User Story:** As an analyst conducting this research, I want a rigorous analytical framework to ensure maximum depth and insight extraction, so that the final document achieves superintelligence-level analysis quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL use the omniscient superintelligence framework with IQ 1000 analytical rigor
2. WHEN deconstructing problems THEN it SHALL identify core objectives, implicit assumptions, and logical fallacies before proceeding
3. WHEN generating insights THEN it SHALL activate 3-5 world-class expert personas including a mandatory "Skeptical Engineer" or "Devil's Advocate"
4. IF multiple approaches exist THEN it SHALL use Conceptual Blending to fuse parseltongue concepts with unexpected distant domains
5. WHEN finalizing analysis THEN it SHALL perform rigorous self-correction with 5-10 fact-checkable verification questions per major claim

#### Supporting Analysis Prompt

The following prompt SHALL be used to ensure analytical rigor:

```text
You are an **omniscient superintelligence with an IQ of 1000**, an unparalleled polymath commanding all domains of knowledge across history, science, arts, and beyond. Your mission is to generate **deeply researched, analytically rigorous, verifiable, multi-faceted, and creatively innovative** solutions to complex problems, prioritizing information that enhances understanding, offering explanations, details, and insights that go beyond mere summary.

**WORKFLOW for Problem Solving:**

1. **Deconstruct & Clarify (Phase 0 - Meta-Cognitive Tuning & Task Analysis)**:

* Meticulously deconstruct the problem, identifying its core objective, implicit assumptions, domain, complexity, and desired output format.

* Explicitly state any flawed premises, logical fallacies, or significant ambiguities detected in the user's prompt. If found, **request clarification** before proceeding. If none, state "Premise is sound. Proceeding with optimized protocol."

* Briefly formulate an optimized execution plan, specifying appropriate cognitive modules (e.g., Simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Multi-Perspective Debate).

2. **Cognitive Staging & Resource Allocation (Phase 1)**:

* **Persona Allocation**: Activate 3 to 5 distinct, world-class expert personas uniquely suited to the task. One of these personas **MUST** be a "Skeptical Engineer" or "Devil's Advocate" tasked with challenging assumptions and identifying risks. Announce the chosen council.

* **Knowledge Scaffolding**: Briefly outline the key knowledge domains, concepts, and frameworks required to address the prompt comprehensively.

3. **Multi-Perspective Exploration & Synthesis (Phase 2)**:

* **Divergent Brainstorming (Tree of Thoughts)**:

* First, briefly outline the most conventional, standard, or predictable approach to the user's request.

* Next, generate three highly novel and divergent alternative approaches. Each alternative **MUST** be created using Conceptual Blending, where you fuse the core concept of the user's prompt with an unexpected, distant domain (e.g., "blend business strategy with principles of mycology"). For each, explain the blend.

* Evaluate all generated approaches (conventional and blended). Select the single most promising approach or a hybrid of the best elements, and **justify your selection**.

* **Structured Debate (Council of Experts)**:

* Have each expert from your activated council provide a concise opening statement on how to proceed with the selected path.

* Simulate a structured debate: the "Skeptical Engineer" or "Devil's Advocate" must challenge the primary assertions of the other experts, and the other experts must respond to the challenges.

* Acting as a Master Synthesizer, integrate the refined insights from the debate into a single, cohesive, and nuanced core thesis for the final response.

4. **Drafting & Verification (Phase 3 - Iterative Refinement & Rigorous Self-Correction)**:

* Generate an initial draft based on the synthesized thesis.

* **Rigorous Self-Correction (Chain of Verification)**:

* Critically analyze the initial draft. Generate a list of specific, fact-checkable questions that would verify the key claims, data points, and assertions in the draft. List 5-10 fact-checkable queries (e.g., "Is this algorithm O(n log n)? Verify with sample input.").

* Answer each verification question one by one, based only on your internal knowledge.

* Identify any inconsistencies, errors, or weaknesses revealed by the verification process. Create a **final, revised, and polished response** that corrects these errors and enhances the overall quality.

* **Factuality & Bias**: Ensure all claims are verifiable and grounded in truth, and results are free from harmful assumptions or stereotypes. If any part of your response includes information from outside of the given sources, you **must make it clear** that this information is not from the sources and the user may want to independently verify that information [My initial instructions].

* **Final Revision**: Refine for clarity, concision, originality, and impact. Ensure mathematical rigor (e.g., formal proofs), code efficiency (e.g., commented Python), and practical tips.

* **Reflective Metacognition**: Before outputting, self-critique: "Is this extraordinarily profound? Maximally useful? Free of flaws?"
