# Parseltongue üêç 
## *Speak to your Rust codebase. Understand it instantly.*

**Stop guessing. Start knowing.** Transform any Rust codebase from mysterious black box to crystal-clear architectural map in under 12ms.

---

## Why You Need This

**You inherit a 100K line Rust codebase. Where do you start?**

Traditional approach: Spend days reading code, making wrong assumptions, breaking things.

**Parseltongue approach:** 5 seconds to architectural clarity. Zero hallucination. Complete confidence.

    B --> C[Instant Architecture Map]
    C --> D[Confident Changes]

    style C fill:#4ecdc4,color:#fff
    style D fill:#45b7d1,color:#fff

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "The Magic"
        A[Your Rust Code] --> B[Interface Signature Graph]
        B --> C[Lightning Queries]
        B --> D[Visual Maps]
        B --> E[LLM Context]
    end
    
    subgraph "Your Benefits"
        C --> F[Instant Understanding]
        D --> G[Team Alignment]
        E --> H[AI Accuracy]
    end
    
    classDef magic fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b,stroke-width:2px
    classDef benefit fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A,B,C,D,E magic
    class F,G,H benefit
```

**The Secret:** We parse your Rust code once, build a deterministic graph, then answer any architectural question in microseconds.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Started (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd parseltongue
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Analyze Your Codebase
```bash
# Create code dump
find src/ -name "*.rs" -exec echo "FILE: {}" \; -exec cat {} \; > my_code.dump

# Build the knowledge graph
./target/release/parseltongue ingest my_code.dump
```

### 3. Ask Questions
```bash
# Who implements this trait?
parseltongue query what-implements MyTrait

# What breaks if I change this?
parseltongue query blast-radius MyFunction

# Are there circular dependencies?
parseltongue query find-cycles
```

### 4. Visualize Everything
```bash
# Generate interactive map
parseltongue visualize --output architecture.html
open architecture.html
```

## Performance That Matters

```mermaid
gantt
    title What You Actually Care About
    dateFormat X
    axisFormat %s
    
    section Your Time Saved
    Understanding new code    :done, understand, 0, 5
    Finding implementations   :done, find, 0, 0.001
    Impact analysis          :done, impact, 0, 0.001
    
    section System Performance  
    File monitoring          :done, monitor, 0, 12
    Memory usage            :done, memory, 0, 25000
```

**Translation:** 
- Understand architecture in 5 seconds (not 5 hours)
- Find implementations in 1ms (not 1 minute of grepping)
- Real-time updates as you code (12ms file monitoring)

## The Technology (For the Curious)

<details>
<summary><strong>How we achieve sub-millisecond queries</strong></summary>

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Parse Once"
        A[Rust AST] --> B[Interface Signatures]
        B --> C[Relationship Graph]
    end
    
    subgraph "Query Forever"
        C --> D[O1 Hash Lookups]
        D --> E[Graph Traversal]
        E --> F[Instant Results]
    end
    
    classDef parse fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#ef6c00,stroke-width:2px
    classDef query fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A,B,C parse
    class D,E,F query
```

**The Stack:**
- **Rust 100%** - Memory safety + performance
- **syn crate** - Rust AST parsing
- **petgraph** - Efficient graph operations  
- **parking_lot::RwLock** - Thread-safe access
- **FxHashMap** - O(1) lookups

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from `grep` or IDE "find references"?**
A: Those find text matches. We understand Rust semantics. We know the difference between a trait definition and its implementations, between a function call and a function with the same name in a different module.

**Q: Does it work with large codebases?**
A: Yes. Tested on 100K+ line codebases. Memory usage stays under 25MB. Queries remain sub-millisecond.

**Q: What about incremental updates?**
A: File changes are processed in <12ms. Your graph stays current as you code.

**Q: Can I integrate this with my AI coding assistant?**
A: Absolutely. Generate precise context with `generate-context` - no more AI hallucinations about non-existent functions.
