**_refDocs ANALYSIS STATUS**: 18/22 documents analyzed with comprehensive extraction of MVP-relevant concepts documented in [architecture-backlog.md](./architecture-backlog.md). 4 large files remain unanalyzed (~8MB total).

#### Task 2: Requirements Quality Assurance
**Goal**: Ensure all 18 MVP requirements meet production quality standards

- [ ] 2.2 Confirm all performance targets are specific and measurable
- [ ] 2.3 Validate all Rust-specific technical details are accurate
- [ ] 2.4 Ensure error handling scenarios are comprehensive
- [ ] 2.5 Check LLM integration requirements are complete and actionable

**Quality Gates**:
- Each requirement has 3-5 measurable acceptance criteria
- Performance targets include exact numbers (ms, Î¼s, MB)
- Rust crate names and patterns are explicitly referenced
- Error scenarios include specific recovery mechanisms
- LLM outputs are deterministic and structured

### Phase 2: Design Document Creation

- [ ] 3.3 Design graph data structures (7 node types, 9 relationship types)
- [ ] 3.4 Specify concurrency model using Arc<RwLock<T>> and DashMap
- [ ] 3.5 Design file system monitoring with `notify` crate integration

#### Task 4: API Specification Design
**Goal**: Complete API design for CLI, HTTP, and structured output interfaces

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] 4.1 Design CLI command structure with clap-based argument parsing
- [ ] 4.2 Specify HTTP API endpoints for LLM integration
- [ ] 4.3 Design structured output formats (JSON, compressed context)
- [ ] 4.4 Specify configuration file format and validation
- [ ] 4.5 Design error response formats and status codes

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

#### Task 5: Implementation Task Breakdown
**Goal**: Create detailed, actionable implementation tasks
**Dependencies**: Tasks 3 and 4 must be complete

**Subtasks**:
- [ ] 5.1 Break down core parsing engine implementation
- [ ] 5.2 Define SQLite integration and schema migration tasks
- [ ] 5.3 Specify graph operations and query implementation tasks
- [ ] 5.4 Plan CLI interface and command handling implementation
- [ ] 5.5 Design testing strategy with unit and integration test tasks

## Backlog Management Strategy

### Immediate Backlog (Post-MVP)
**Version 1.5 Features** (3-6 months post-MVP):
- In-memory caching layer for hot queries
- Advanced Rust pattern recognition (macros, lifetimes)
- Enhanced error recovery and resilience
- Performance monitoring and alerting

### Medium-term Backlog
**Version 2.0 Features** (6-12 months post-MVP):
- Multi-workspace and cargo workspace support
- Advanced architectural pattern detection
- Code quality metrics and technical debt analysis
- CI/CD integration and automation

### Long-term Backlog
**Version 3.0+ Features** (12+ months post-MVP):
- Graph database migration (MemGraph/SurrealDB)
- Distributed codebase analysis
- Enterprise security and access control
- Advanced LLM integration patterns

### Backlog Decision Framework
**Move to backlog if**:
1. Doesn't directly support Rust-only constraint
2. Would compromise <12ms update performance
3. Adds complexity without clear LLM-terminal value
4. Requires technologies beyond SQLite + Rust ecosystem
5. Serves enterprise needs beyond MVP scope

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas for MVP
1. **Performance Targets**: <12ms may be challenging with complex parsing
2. **Memory Management**: Keeping large graphs under memory limits
3. **Rust Complexity**: Handling edge cases in type system
4. **Concurrency**: Thread-safe updates without performance loss

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Performance**: Profile early, optimize incrementally, use benchmarks
2. **Memory**: Efficient data structures, lazy loading, compression
3. **Complexity**: 80/20 rule - handle common cases first, edge cases later
4. **Concurrency**: Simple patterns (Arc<RwLock<T>>), avoid complex coordination
