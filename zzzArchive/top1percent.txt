Just one thing - I am trying to become a power user of tokio rust library - does this module structure and approach help me do that?

Use @Web  to further - understand - use case is - I want this work to showcase my mastery of tokio async ecosystem - how could I structure my approach such that @step01_scope.txt is done with this objective as well - discuss in a verbose manner

Now tell me a single terminal command which will change the attached tree structure of /home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/parseltongue/phase01 to what you have outlined in @step02_modules.txt

WHY ARE there fies outside of @phase01  ? why ddi you give me such a terminal command

Again - compare this structure of the folder /home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/parseltongue/phase01 - with what you have in @step02_modules.txt  - tell me what is different missing or excess - (ignore step*.txt files they are not to be touched)

Are you sure that @step02_modules.txt is the best possible solution in terms of module file directory strcucture - as per your research on @RustDocs @Web ?

Yes update @step02_modules.txt

What if I am happy with complex drawbacks

Yes please go ahead - do you think we mgiht need update @step01_scope.txt document? - shall we update it with more scope

No we seem good

// Implementation Prompts
Update @types.rs  - witha Pyramid structure of - Before starting code explain pyramidal nature of code via comments and then as the code gets detailed explain design choice nuances

Now give me based @Web  - in order to implement the @step02_modules.txt  - what should be the most logical order of files to update 1 by 1

Ok now update @error.rs  with bug free rigorous code

Can you also update @error.rs  the same pyramidal style of comments as you did in @types.rs 

Lets move on to the next file we need to update

Update @worker.rs  - witha Pyramid structure of - Before starting code explain pyramidal nature of code via comments and then as the code gets detailed explain design choice nuances

Tell me what is done, what is left, what is next 

Update @shutdown.rs    - witha Pyramid structure of - Before starting code explain pyramidal nature of code via comments and then as the code gets detailed explain design choice nuances

Can you append all the prompts used in this composue in last 1 hour in @top1percent.txt - all that I told you and asked you as is

Can you go back to last 6 hours Can you append all the prompts used in this composue  in @top1percent.txt - all that I told you and asked you as is
