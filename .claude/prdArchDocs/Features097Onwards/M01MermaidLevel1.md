# Esssence

Current token lenght of models = 200k tokens
Current size of code = 5000k tokens
You canNOT reason properly with such context length

imagine if your ceo asked for insights of last 1 week of data which at granular level exists at 1 minute intervals = 1 x 60 x 24 x  7 = 10080 data points
- do you show him each 10080 data points for insights to help him take decisions
- you can show him it to be aggregated percentile distribution or mean or sum of
    - 10080 data points at minute basis
    - 168 data points at hourly basis
    - 7 data points at day basis

RCA
- If CEO think some problem is there on Tuesday - does he start with 10800 data points OR does he first pick the day on which the issue might have happened?
- Then goes to hour
- then goes to minute


Similar analogy
- Map of India has 25 states
- Each State 20 cities
- Each City 50 key neighbourhoods
- We see 1 video of a neighbourhood of something thing wrong
- Do we run all the video clips of 25 x 20 x 50 = 50000 videos ?
    - Can we approximate which state
    - Can we approximate which city
    - Can we approximate which neighbourhood?

# Objective
With minimal context spent we give highest amount of signal to an LLM to reason throught the codebase

## Definitions
- Define interfaces : struct i.e. class, type; functions or generics ; statements; libraries which are basically functions; modules which are basically functions; files behave as modules;
- Code is written in filepath-filename-line-numbers
- Code in action by compiler is actually a graph of interfaces connected to each other via multiple relationships

## Why not graph databases to store code?
- Since the fundamental operations of a compiler are multi-relationship manipulators, a code should exist in a graph database
- An incremental way to think of it is, for the sake of humans, keep the files in tree lije filesystems, but to run a compiler immediately ingest them into a a graphdatabase for faster higher quality compilation
    - Level 1 - write code in filesystem - CURRENT SYTEM
    - Level 2 - ingest code in graphdatabase - run a faster x higher quality compiler to check what the agent did or you did almost like a REPL
    - Level 3 - before final binary run a traditional proven existing compile



## Why lines are the addresses of functions in a file? And should they be so?


### Assignment of Primary Key

What are the biggest disadvantages of a <filepath>-<file-name>-<interface-name>-<interface-type>-<line-start>-<line-end> = ADDRESS01?

Other types of interfaces can be ADDRESS01-<interface-name>-... - problem is line-start AND line-end IS DEPENDENT ON THE CONTENT OF THE 3 things
- current interface whose address you are looking at
    - it can grow in size
    - it can shrink in size
- preceding interfaces
- succeding interfaces - MAYBE ?

e.g. 
       "key": "rust:struct:Cli:__crates_pt06-cozodb-make-future-code-current_src_cli_rs:7-23",
       "file": "./crates/pt06-cozodb-make-future-code-current/src/cli.rs"

Especially in context of storing it in a database?


## Solutions

### Solution 01

Define an address of a code block
- file-path
    -  file-name
        - interface-array-index-number
            - a text value

parseltongue-src-main.rs-[0] = `use clap::{Arg, ArgMatches, Command};`
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[1] = `use console::style;`
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[2] = `use anyhow::{Result, Context};"
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[3] = `use std::path::PathBuf;"
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[4] = `use std::collections::HashMap;"
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[5]= `use pt01_folder_to_cozodb_streamer::streamer::FileStreamer;"
parseltongue-src-main.rs-[6]-`use parseltongue_core::entities`= "use parseltongue_core::entities::{
    CodeEntity, TemporalState, InterfaceSignature, EntityType, Visibility,
    LineRange, Language, LanguageSpecificSignature, RustSignature,
    TddClassification, EntityClass, TestabilityLevel, ComplexityLevel, RiskLevel,
    EntityMetadata,
};"





Simulations
- Can we add more information about interfaces to post-array-number-
