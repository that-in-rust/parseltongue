# Esssence


## Definitions
- Define interfaces : struct i.e. class, type; functions or generics ; statements; libraries which are basically functions; modules which are basically functions; files behave as modules;
- Code is written in filepath-filename-line-numbers
- Code in action by compiler is actually a graph of interfaces connected to each other via multiple relationships

## Why not graph databases to store code?


## Why lines are the addresses of functions in a file?
