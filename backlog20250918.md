# AIM Tool - Feature Backlog

## Moved from Ideation Document

### Core Inspiration from Reference Documents

#### From Notes01.md - The Aggregated Codebase Vision
The reference documents reveal a sophisticated architectural philosophy:

1. **Static Verification over Runtime Contracts**: Moving integration verification from runtime to compile-time
2. **Cross-Platform Logic Identity**: Same core logic running everywhere (native, WASM, FFI)
3. **Dynamic Composability**: "Sliceable" aggregates that can be deployed as monolith or microservices
4. **Interface Signature Graph (ISG)**: Compressing complex codebases into deterministic navigation maps

#### From Notes02.md - Executable Specifications Framework
The documents outline a paradigm shift from narrative to algorithmic specifications:

1. **Design by Contract (DbC)**: Formal contracts with preconditions, postconditions, invariants
2. **TDD as Machine-Readable Protocol**: Tests as unambiguous communication with LLMs
3. **L1-L4 Framework**: Layered specification approach from constraints to user journeys
4. **Verification Harness**: Single executable definition of "flawless"

#### From Notes03.md - Interface-Stub Implementation
Revolutionary implementation patterns emerge:

1. **JSONL Specifications**: Complete interface definitions in machine-readable format
2. **SigHash IDs**: BLAKE3-based stable identifiers for blast radius analysis
3. **Bounded Context Generation**: SQLite queries for precise LLM context
4. **Property-Based Verification**: Automated correctness validation

### Advanced Technical Implementation Details

#### Multi-Language AST Parsing
```rust
// Core parsing engine
pub struct AimExtractor {
    parsers: HashMap<Language, Box<dyn LanguageParser>>,
    graph: InterfaceGraph,
    sighash_gen: SigHashGenerator,
}

pub trait LanguageParser {
    fn extract_nodes(&self, source: &str) -> Vec<GraphNode>;
    fn extract_edges(&self, source: &str) -> Vec<GraphEdge>;
    fn normalize_signature(&self, signature: &str) -> String;
}
```

#### Cross-Language Interface Detection
```rust
pub struct CrossLanguageAnalyzer {
    rust_graph: InterfaceGraph,
    typescript_graph: InterfaceGraph,
}
```

#### Temporal Analysis
```rust
pub struct TemporalAnalyzer {
    snapshots: Vec<(DateTime<Utc>, InterfaceGraph)>,
}
```

#### Semantic Clustering
```rust
pub struct SemanticClusterer {
    embeddings: HashMap<SigHash, Vec<f32>>,
}
```
