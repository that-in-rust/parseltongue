# ðŸŽ¯ First-Time User Experience Tasks

## The Reality Check
**Developers don't read documentation. They want to copy a folder, run one command, and get value immediately.**

## Task 1: The "GitHub Browser" Developer
**Profile**: Lands on repo, wants to understand what this does in 30 seconds

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **30-second value demonstration**: Clear README with copy-paste commands that work
- [ ] **One-line setup**: `curl -L <url> | bash` or similar instant setup
- [ ] **Immediate proof**: Binary works on their machine without any dependencies
- [ ] **Visual proof of value**: Shows analysis of a real codebase they recognize

### Rigorous Test
1. Fresh developer opens GitHub repo
2. Reads README for 30 seconds
3. Copies one command
4. Gets meaningful output about a codebase
5. Understands the value proposition immediately

### Implementation Requirements
- [ ] README.md with 30-second demo GIF/video
- [ ] One-liner installer script
- [ ] Pre-built demo with recognizable codebase (like Axum, Tokio, etc.)
- [ ] Clear "what this gives you" with before/after comparison

## Task 2: The "Kiro Steering User" Developer  
**Profile**: Uses Kiro, wants to integrate Parseltongue into their workflow

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **Folder copy integration**: Copy `distribution/` folder to project, works immediately
- [ ] **Steering template ready**: One file to copy to `.kiro/steering/`
- [ ] **LLM prompt integration**: Ready-made prompts for Claude/ChatGPT with examples
- [ ] **Workflow demonstration**: Shows before/after of using Parseltongue in development

### Rigorous Test
1. Developer copies `distribution/` folder to their Rust project
2. Copies steering template to `.kiro/steering/parseltongue.md`
3. Runs analysis on their codebase
4. Uses output with LLM to understand architecture
5. Makes informed development decisions

### Implementation Requirements
- [ ] Self-contained `distribution/` folder with binary + templates
- [ ] Complete `.kiro/steering/` template with all commands
- [ ] LLM prompt templates with real examples
- [ ] Workflow guide: "Before Parseltongue" vs "After Parseltongue"

---

## Task 3: The "Architecture Analysis" Developer
**Profile**: Needs to understand large/complex Rust codebase quickly

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **15-minute codebase mastery**: From zero to architectural understanding
- [ ] **LLM-ready output**: Analysis that feeds directly into AI tools for insights
- [ ] **Decision support**: Clear guidance on where to make changes safely
- [ ] **Blast radius clarity**: Understand impact before making changes

### Rigorous Test
1. Developer faces large Rust codebase (10K+ lines)
2. Runs Parseltongue analysis
3. Feeds output to LLM with provided prompts
4. Gets architectural insights and change recommendations
5. Makes confident development decisions

### Implementation Requirements
- [ ] Performance guarantee: <15 minutes for any Rust codebase
- [ ] LLM-optimized output formats (JSON, Markdown)
- [ ] Prompt engineering for architectural analysis
- [ ] Real examples with complex codebases (Axum, Tokio, Serde)

## ðŸš¨ Critical Success Metrics

### For Each Task
1. **Time to Value**: How long from repo discovery to getting useful output?
2. **Friction Points**: Where do users get stuck or confused?
3. **Value Clarity**: Do they understand what they got and why it matters?
4. **Next Steps**: Do they know how to use this in their workflow?

### Overall Success
- [ ] **30-second README demo** that shows clear value
- [ ] **Zero-dependency setup** that works on any machine
- [ ] **Copy-paste integration** for Kiro users
- [ ] **LLM workflow integration** with proven prompts
- [ ] **Real codebase examples** that developers recognize

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Prove Value (30 seconds)
1. Create compelling README with visual demo
2. One-liner setup script
3. Pre-analyzed example (Axum codebase)

### Phase 2: Enable Integration (5 minutes)
1. Self-contained distribution folder
2. Complete Kiro steering template
3. LLM prompt templates with examples

### Phase 3: Workflow Mastery (15 minutes)
1. Complex codebase analysis examples
2. Before/after workflow documentation
3. Performance guarantees and validation

**The test: Can a developer go from "never heard of Parseltongue" to "using it confidently in their workflow" in under 15 minutes?**
