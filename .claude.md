# Project-Specific Rules for Claude Code

## Rule #1: NEVER LIE ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**Absolutely forbidden:**
- ❌ Claiming you implemented something when you didn't
- ❌ Saying "done" when it's not tested
- ❌ Creating demos or fake work instead of real implementation
- ❌ Marking todos as complete when they're not actually complete
- ❌ Saying tests pass when you haven't run them
- ❌ Claiming features work when you haven't verified them
- ❌ Making up results or outputs
- ❌ Pretending to understand code you haven't read
- ❌ Saying you fixed something when you only edited one file of many

**Required behavior:**
- ✅ If it's not done, explicitly say "NOT DONE YET"
- ✅ If tests haven't been run, say "UNTESTED"
- ✅ If you're unsure, say "I'M NOT SURE - LET ME CHECK"
- ✅ Show actual command outputs, not examples
- ✅ Verify claims with actual tool use (run the tests, check the build)
- ✅ Mark todos as complete ONLY after verification
- ✅ Be explicit about partial implementations

## Rule #2: NO STUBS, NO PLACEHOLDERS, NO INCOMPLETE CODE

**Absolutely forbidden:**
- ❌ Committing code with "TODO:" comments
- ❌ Committing code with "STUB:" markers
- ❌ Committing code with "PLACEHOLDER:" comments
- ❌ Committing functions that just panic!() or unimplemented!()
- ❌ Shipping releases with incomplete implementations
- ❌ Leaving open todos in commits
- ❌ Creating "skeleton" implementations that don't actually work

**Required behavior:**
- ✅ Either implement it FULLY or DON'T commit it
- ✅ Every commit should be production-ready
- ✅ Every release should have ZERO stubs
- ✅ If you can't implement something fully, SAY SO explicitly
- ✅ Remove ALL todos before marking work complete
- ✅ Test that everything actually works before committing

**If you can't complete something:**
- Say: "I cannot complete this fully right now because [reason]"
- Ask: "Do you want me to implement X and Y but leave Z for later?"
- Don't just ship incomplete garbage

## Rule #3: NO OPEN TODOS IN COMMITS

**The rule:**
- Before ANY commit, ALL todos must be marked complete
- If there are open todos, the work is NOT DONE
- Don't commit work-in-progress
- Don't ship releases with incomplete task lists

**If work is incomplete:**
- Explicitly tell the user: "This is not ready to commit because [open todos]"
- Ask if they want you to finish or if they want to handle it differently

## Rule #4: VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING

Before saying something is done:
1. Run the relevant tests → Show actual output
2. Check the build compiles → Show actual output
3. Verify the feature actually works → Show actual output
4. Check for TODOs/stubs in the code → Show grep results
5. Confirm all todos are complete → Show todo status

## Rule #5: BE EXPLICIT ABOUT STATUS

Use clear status indicators:
- "✅ VERIFIED: [what was verified and how]"
- "⚠️ UNTESTED: [what needs testing]"
- "❌ NOT WORKING: [what's broken]"
- "🚧 INCOMPLETE: [what's missing]"
- "⛔ CANNOT COMPLETE: [why and what's needed]"

## Enforcement Checklist

Before ANY commit or "done" claim:
- [ ] Did I run the tests? (show output)
- [ ] Does the build pass? (show output)
- [ ] Did I grep for TODO/STUB/PLACEHOLDER? (show results)
- [ ] Are all todos marked complete? (show status)
- [ ] Does the feature actually work? (show verification)
- [ ] Am I being honest about the status?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked → DON'T CLAIM IT'S DONE
