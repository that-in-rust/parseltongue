- Helper functions: create_test_entity(), create_test_entity_rich_format()
- Documents architectural insights in module-level comment

**Pattern Applied:** Executable specifications with real database integration

#### 2. tests/demo_5_line_change.rs (+122 lines - NEW FILE)
**Key Features:**
- Interactive demonstration of entity-level precision
- Shows 5-line function change within 40-line file
- Clear JSON output showing line_range: [8, 12]
- Educational value: demonstrates "why" behind enhanced schema

**Pattern Applied:** Living documentation through executable examples

#### 3. src/diff_generator.rs (+63 insertions)
**Key Changes:**
- Line 28-62: Added `extract_line_range()` method (parses rich ISGL1 format)
- Line 64-104: Added `extract_file_path_simple()` (handles simple format)
- Line 106-146: Enhanced `entity_to_change_diff()` (includes current_code + line_range)
- Line 148-189: Updated `generate_diff()` to use real database queries

**Architectural Insight (from module doc):**
```
Why current_code + line_range?
- Prevents LLM from rewriting entire 1000-line files
- Enables surgical edits: change 5 lines, not 1000
- Example: Edit calculate_total() at lines 42-56, not entire src/lib.rs
```

**Pattern Applied:** Entity-level precision with surgical editing

#### 4. src/diff_types.rs (+40 insertions)
**Key Changes:**
- Line 35-37: Added `current_code: Option<String>` field to ChangeDiff
- Line 38-40: Added `line_range: Option<Vec<u32>>` field to ChangeDiff

**Schema Enhancement:**
```rust
pub struct ChangeDiff {
    pub file_path: String,
    pub operation: String,
    pub future_code: Option<String>,
    pub current_code: Option<String>,    // NEW: baseline for LLM
    pub line_range: Option<Vec<u32>>,    // NEW: [start_line, end_line]
}
```

**Pattern Applied:** Minimal schema changes for maximum precision

#### 5. src/lib.rs (+9 insertions)
**Key Changes:**
- Line 12: Exported integration_tests module (tests visible to cargo test)
- Enabled comprehensive integration testing

#### 6. src/main.rs (+8 insertions)
**Key Changes:**
- Line 45: Updated placeholder logic for enhanced schema
- Future enhancement point documented

## Current Focus

Tool 5 enhanced schema is 100% complete. All architectural goals achieved:
- Entity-level precision (not file-level) ✅
- Current code baseline for LLM comparison ✅
- Line range targeting for surgical edits ✅
- Both ISGL1 formats supported ✅
- Real CozoDB integration with Arc wrapper ✅
- Interactive demo showing 5-line change precision ✅

---

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Legacy writer.rs Module**
   - Current status: 12 dead_code warnings from old module
   - Action: Safe to delete, fully replaced by diff_generator.rs
   - Impact: Cleaner codebase, zero warnings

2. **Add Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure: Diff generation time for 100-entity codebase
   - Target: <200ms for typical change sets
   - Tool: Criterion.rs benchmarks

3. **Integration with Tool 4 (rust-preflight-code-simulator)**
   - Tool 4 will validate line_range edits before applying
   - Ensure surgical edits don't break compilation
   - End-to-end pipeline: Tool 5 → Tool 4 validation

4. **Integration with LLM Application Layer**
   - LLM reads CodeDiff.json
   - LLM applies changes using file_path + line_range + current_code/future_code
   - Test with real Claude Code agent

---

## Context Notes

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Entity-Level Precision (Not File-Level)**
- Problem: Original schema would make LLM rewrite entire files
- Solution: Added line_range field to target specific entity boundaries
- Benefit: 5-line function edit doesn't touch other 995 lines
- Example: calculate_total() at lines 42-56, not entire src/lib.rs
- Reference: demo_5_line_change.rs shows this in action

**Decision 2: Include current_code for Baseline**
- Problem: LLM needs to see "before" state to generate precise "after" state
- Solution: Added current_code alongside future_code
- Benefit: LLM can do contextual diff reasoning, not blind replacement
- Trade-off: Slightly larger JSON, but critical for edit quality

**Decision 3: Support Both ISGL1 Formats**
- Format 1 (Simple): `src-math-rs-add` → `src/math.rs`
- Format 2 (Rich): `rust:fn:calculate_total:src_lib_rs:10-25` → `src/lib.rs` + lines 10-25
- Rationale: Backward compatibility with Tool 1 output variants
- Implementation: Two parsing methods, fallback logic

**Decision 4: Arc<CozoDbStorage> Wrapper for Testing**
- Problem: Tests couldn't pass real database to diff generator
- Solution: Created CozoDbStorageArc wrapper with Arc::new()
- Benefit: Real database integration tests, not mocks
- Pattern: Same as Tool 3 refactoring (established pattern)

**Decision 5: Interactive Demo File**
- Purpose: Show "why" behind schema enhancement to developers
- Audience: Future maintainers, code reviewers, users
- Format: Executable test that prints JSON to stdout
- Value: Living documentation that can't go stale

### Approaches Attempted

1. **File-Level Diffs (REJECTED)**
   - Initial approach: ChangeDiff only had file_path + future_code
   - Problem: LLM would rewrite entire 1000-line files for 5-line changes
   - Final: Added line_range for surgical precision

2. **Rich ISGL1 Format Only (REJECTED)**
   - Initial approach: Only parse `rust:fn:name:path:lines` format
   - Problem: Tool 1 might generate simpler `path-name` format
   - Final: Support both formats with fallback logic

3. **Mock Database in Integration Tests (REJECTED)**
   - Initial approach: Mock CozoDbStorage for tests
   - Problem: Doesn't validate real database integration
   - Final: Arc wrapper enables real database testing

### Blockers or Questions

**RESOLVED:**
- ISGL1 format ambiguity - Fixed with dual-format parsing
- Database integration testing - Fixed with Arc wrapper pattern
- Line range extraction - Fixed with regex parsing
- File path reconstruction - Fixed with desanitization logic

**NONE REMAINING:**
- All 25 tests passing (18 lib + 6 integration + 1 demo)
- All architectural goals met
- All integration points working
- Remote repository synchronized

### Technical Debt Identified

1. **Legacy writer.rs Module (Removal Pending)**
   - Status: 12 dead_code warnings (entire module unused)
   - Reason: Fully replaced by diff_generator.rs enhanced schema
   - Action: Safe to delete in next cleanup commit
   - Priority: Low (doesn't affect functionality, just warnings)

2. **Performance Benchmarks Missing**
   - Status: No criterion benchmarks yet
   - Reason: Focused on correctness first (TDD approach)
   - Action: Add benchmarks in performance optimization phase
   - Priority: Medium (should validate <200ms target)

3. **Error Messages Could Be More Specific**
   - Current: Generic "Invalid ISGL1 format" error
   - Improvement: Show which format was attempted, what was expected
   - Action: Enhance error types with context
   - Priority: Low (errors are rare, parsing is robust)

## Architecture Principles Applied

### From S01-README-MOSTIMP.md

✅ **Principle 3: Dependency Injection**
- Arc<CozoDbStorage> injected into DiffGenerator
- Enables testability with real database instances
- Implementation: DiffGenerator::new(Arc::new(storage))

✅ **Ultra-Minimalist Approach**
- Single JSON output: CodeDiff.json
- NO backup files (verified in PRD)
- Direct file path + line range + code diffs
- Removed unnecessary abstractions (legacy writer.rs)

✅ **Executable Specifications**
- 6 integration tests document requirements
- 1 demo test shows practical usage
- Tests serve as living documentation

### From S02-code-conventions.md

✅ **L3 Async/Await Patterns**
- Tokio async patterns throughout
- Proper error propagation with ?
- Implementation: async fn generate_diff()

✅ **L2 Arc for Shared State**
- Arc<CozoDbStorage> for thread-safe sharing
- Pattern: Arc::new(storage)
- Benefit: Multiple tests can use same storage instance

✅ **L1 Result Types**
- Proper error handling with Result<T, DiffGeneratorError>
- thiserror for library errors
- Implementation: All functions return Result

### From S06-design101-tdd-architecture-principles.md

✅ **TDD-First Development**
- RED: 6 failing integration tests created first
- GREEN: Enhanced schema implementation to pass tests
- REFACTOR: Applied Arc wrapper pattern, added demo

✅ **Contract-Based Design**
- DiffGenerator trait defines interface (generate_diff method)
- ChangeDiff structure defines output contract
- Tests verify contract compliance

✅ **Performance Contracts** (Future)
- Noted in technical debt: add criterion benchmarks
- Target: <200ms diff generation for 100 entities
- Approach: Automated performance validation

## How to Resume Work

### If Continuing Tool 5 Development

1. **Read Status Documents**
   - This file: `/Users/amuldotexe/Projects/parseltongue/TDD-SESSION-TOOL5-COMPLETION.md`
   - Overall status: `/Users/amuldotexe/Projects/parseltongue/TDD-Tracker.md`
   - PRD compliance: `/Users/amuldotexe/Projects/parseltongue/.prdArchDocs/P02PRDL2Detailed.md`

2. **Run Tests to Verify Baseline**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/amuldotexe/Projects/parseltongue
   cargo test --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer
   # Expected: 25/25 passing in ~0.12s (12 warnings from legacy writer.rs)
   ```

3. **Run Demo to See Enhanced Schema in Action**
   ```bash
   cargo test --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer --test demo_5_line_change -- --nocapture
   # Output: Pretty-printed CodeDiff.json showing 5-line surgical edit
   ```

4. **Check Current Branch**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should be on 'ultrathink' branch
   # Should show "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/ultrathink'"
   ```

5. **Review Key Implementation Files**
   - Start with: `crates/llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer/src/diff_generator.rs`
   - Key method: `entity_to_change_diff()` (includes current_code + line_range)
   - Tests: `tests/integration_tests.rs` (431 lines of comprehensive coverage)
   - Demo: `tests/demo_5_line_change.rs` (interactive demonstration)

### If Implementing Integration with Other Tools

1. **Tool 5 Output Format (CodeDiff.json)**
   - Read: CodeDiff and ChangeDiff structures in `diff_types.rs:9-42`
   - Key fields:
     - file_path: Reconstructed from ISGL1 key
     - operation: "Create" | "Edit" | "Delete"
     - future_code: New code to apply
     - current_code: Existing code baseline (for Edit operations)
     - line_range: [start_line, end_line] for surgical edits

2. **LLM Application Pattern**
   ```
   LLM reads CodeDiff.json:
   1. For each ChangeDiff:
      a. Read file_path (e.g., "src/lib.rs")
      b. If operation == "Edit":
         - Read current_code (baseline)
         - Read future_code (target)
         - Read line_range (e.g., [42, 56])
         - Apply: Replace lines 42-56 with future_code
      c. If operation == "Create":
         - Write future_code to new file at file_path
      d. If operation == "Delete":
         - Delete file at file_path
   ```

3. **Integration with Tool 4 (Validation)**
   - Tool 4 should validate line_range edits:
     - Extract entity at specified line range
     - Validate syntax of future_code
     - Check: Does it compile in context?
     - Return: ValidationResult with errors if any

### If Debugging Issues

1. **Run Tests with Output**
   ```bash
   cargo test --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer -- --nocapture
   ```

2. **Check ISGL1 Format Parsing**
   ```rust
   // In tests, add debug output:
   let file_path = diff_generator.extract_file_path(&entity.isgl1_key)?;
   let line_range = diff_generator.extract_line_range(&entity.isgl1_key)?;
   println!("Parsed: {} -> file={}, lines={:?}", entity.isgl1_key, file_path, line_range);
   ```

3. **Verify Diff Output Format**
   ```bash
   # Generate diff and inspect JSON:
   cargo run --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer -- \
     --database parseltongue.db \
     --output diff.json
   cat diff.json | jq .
   ```

4. **Test Entity-Level Precision**
   ```bash
   # Run demo to see 5-line edit in action:
   cargo test --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer --test demo_5_line_change -- --nocapture
   # Look for: line_range: [8, 12] in output
   ```

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Branch:** ultrathink

**Commit Message:**
```
feat(tool5): enhance CodeDiff schema with current_code + line_range (TDD)

Completed RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle for enhanced Tool 5 schema:

Phase 1 RED - Executable Specifications:
- Added 6 failing integration tests defining entity-level precision requirements
- Test coverage: line_range extraction, current_code inclusion, multi-entity files,
  ISGL1 format parsing (both simple and rich), file path desanitization, CozoDB integration

Phase 2 GREEN - Enhanced Schema Implementation:
- Added current_code field to ChangeDiff (LLM needs baseline for comparison)
- Added line_range field to ChangeDiff (enables surgical edits, not full-file rewrites)
- Implemented extract_line_range() for rich ISGL1 format parsing
- Enhanced entity_to_change_diff() to populate new fields
- Updated generate_diff() to use real CozoDB queries (Arc wrapper pattern)

Phase 3 REFACTOR - Real Database Integration:
- Applied Arc<CozoDbStorage> wrapper pattern (from Tool 3 precedent)
- Enabled real database integration tests (not mocks)
- Added comprehensive module-level documentation explaining architecture
- Created helper functions for test entity creation

Architectural Insight:
- Why entity-level precision? Prevents LLM from rewriting entire 1000-line files
- Example: Edit calculate_total() at lines 42-56, not entire src/lib.rs
- Benefit: Surgical edits preserve surrounding code, reduce merge conflicts

Test Results:
- 25 tests total: 18 lib + 6 integration + 1 demo
- All passing (100% success rate)
- Real database integration verified
```

**Files Changed:** 5 files, 551 insertions, 23 deletions
- tests/integration_tests.rs (431 lines, NEW)
- src/diff_generator.rs (63 additions)
- src/diff_types.rs (40 additions)
- src/lib.rs (9 additions)
- src/main.rs (8 additions)

### Commit 2: Interactive Demo

**Commit Hash:** e3da25a
**Author:** amuldotexe
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Branch:** ultrathink

**Commit Message:**
```
docs(tool5): add interactive demo for 5-line code change

Added executable demonstration showing entity-level precision in action.

Demo Scenario:
- 40-line file (src/math.rs) with 3 functions
- Target: calculate_sum() at lines 8-12 (5 lines)
- Result: CodeDiff.json targets ONLY those 5 lines, not entire file

Why This Demo Matters:
1. Shows practical benefit of enhanced schema
2. Demonstrates surgical edit precision
3. Serves as living documentation
4. Educational for developers and code reviewers

How to Run:
```bash
cargo test --package llm-cozodb-to-diff-writer --test demo_5_line_change -- --nocapture
```

Output: Pretty-printed JSON showing line_range: [8, 12]

This demo validates the core value proposition: change 5 lines, not 1000.
```

**Files Changed:** 1 file, 122 insertions
- tests/demo_5_line_change.rs (122 lines, NEW)

## Known Limitations (Acceptable for MVP)

### 1. Legacy writer.rs Module (12 warnings)
**Status:** Entire module unused, replaced by diff_generator.rs
**Reason:** Enhanced schema made old approach obsolete
**Action:** Safe to delete in cleanup commit
**Impact:** 12 dead_code warnings, no functional impact
**Priority:** Low (cosmetic issue only)

### 2. Performance Benchmarks Missing
**Status:** No criterion.rs benchmarks yet
**Target:** <200ms diff generation for 100 entities
**Reason:** TDD focused on correctness first
**Action:** Add benchmarks in performance optimization phase
**Priority:** Medium (should validate performance claims)

### 3. Error Messages Generic
**Current:** "Invalid ISGL1 format" without specifics
**Improvement:** Show which format attempted, what expected
**Reason:** Error path rarely exercised (parsing is robust)
**Action:** Enhance error context in future refactor
**Priority:** Low (errors are rare)

### 4. Line Range Validation Missing
**Current:** Accepts any [start, end] line range
**Improvement:** Validate: start < end, start > 0, end < file_length
**Reason:** Trust LLM/Tool 1 to provide valid ranges
**Action:** Add validation in Tool 4 (preflight validation)
**Priority:** Medium (should validate before applying)

### Tool 5 Role in Pipeline

```
Codebase → [Tool 1] → CozoDB → [Tool 2] → CozoDB → [Tool 3] → CodeGraphContext.json
                                                          ↓
                                                  [Tool 4: Validate]
                                                          ↓
                                                  [Tool 5: Diff Writer] → CodeDiff.json
                                                          ↓
                                                  [LLM applies changes]
                                                          ↓
                                                  [Tool 6: State Reset]
```

**Tool 5 Responsibilities:**
1. Query CozoDB for entities with Future_Action set (Create/Edit/Delete)
2. Extract file paths from ISGL1 keys (both formats)
3. Extract line ranges for surgical edits (rich format)
4. Include current_code baseline for LLM comparison
5. Generate CodeDiff.json with ChangeDiff array

**Tool 5 Guarantees:**
- Output includes precise line_range for Edit operations
- Output includes current_code baseline for context
- Output supports both ISGL1 formats (simple and rich)
- Output follows ultra-minimalist principles (single JSON, no backups)
- Output ready for LLM consumption and application

### Cross-Tool Dependencies

**Tool 5 depends on:**
- Tool 1: ISGL1 keys correctly formatted
- Tool 2: Future_Action correctly set (Create/Edit/Delete)
- Tool 2: future_code populated for entities with Future_Action

**Tools that depend on Tool 5:**
- LLM Application Layer: Reads CodeDiff.json and applies changes
- Tool 4: Could validate line_range edits before applying
- Tool 6: Triggers after file changes applied
