# Parseltongue - Phase 01

A high-performance, async Rust tool for analyzing and processing ZIP archives.

## Vision

Parseltongue aims to be a comprehensive suite of tools for code analysis, dependency tracking, and security scanning of software projects. The name reflects its ability to "speak" to and understand various code formats, much like Harry Potter's parseltongue ability.

## Current Implementation: Phase 01

Phase 01 focuses on establishing a robust foundation with ZIP processing and storage capabilities.
