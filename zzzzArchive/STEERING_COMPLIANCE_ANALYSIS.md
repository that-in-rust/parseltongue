# Steering Compliance Analysis

## Current Issues Found

### 1. **TDD-First Architecture Violations**
- ❌ **No executable specifications**: Functions lack preconditions/postconditions
- ❌ **No performance contracts**: Claims like "<5μs" not backed by tests
- ❌ **Incomplete error hierarchies**: ISGError doesn't cover all failure modes
- ❌ **No dependency injection**: Hard dependencies on concrete types

### 2. **Code Convention Violations**
- ❌ **Mixed error handling**: Should use thiserror for library, anyhow for CLI
- ❌ **No RAII patterns**: Resources not properly managed with Drop
- ❌ **Hard dependencies**: ParseltongueAIM has concrete file_watcher dependency
- ❌ **Oversimplified models**: NodeData doesn't handle real Rust complexity

### 3. **Parseltongue Focus Violations**
- ❌ **Performance not validated**: 6μs node operations exceed 5μs target
- ❌ **No memory constraints**: No validation of <25MB for 100K LOC
- ❌ **Missing compression metrics**: No >95% token reduction validation

## Required Fixes

### Phase 1: Fix Core Architecture (Following TDD-First)
1. **Add executable specifications** with contracts
2. **Implement dependency injection** for testability
3. **Add performance contract tests** for all claims
4. **Implement proper RAII** resource management

### Phase 2: Fix Error Handling (Following Code Conventions)
1. **Use thiserror for ISGError** (library errors)
2. **Use anyhow for CLI errors** (application context)
3. **Add exhaustive error hierarchies**
4. **Implement structured error boundaries**

### Phase 3: Fix Performance Validation (Following Requirements Focus)
1. **Add <12ms update contract tests**
2. **Add <500μs query contract tests**
3. **Add <25MB memory constraint tests**
4. **Add >95% compression validation**

## Axum Test Issue Analysis

The Axum test revealed:
- ✅ **Parsing works**: 295 files processed, 693 nodes created
- ❌ **No persistence**: Nodes don't persist between CLI commands
- ❌ **No performance validation**: 1.35s ingestion not validated against constraints
- ❌ **No error analysis**: Parse errors logged but not categorized
- ❌ **No ISG visualization**: Can't see what was actually extracted

## Next Steps
1. Fix the persistence issue (daemon state not shared between commands)
2. Add performance contract validation for the Axum test
3. Implement proper error categorization and reporting
4. Add ISG analysis and visualization for the extracted data
