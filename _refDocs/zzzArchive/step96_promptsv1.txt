=============== 

WE FIRST NEED TO CHECK @step02_module.txt  IS IT IN LINE WITH @step01_scope.txt 

Update @step02_module.txt  as per the following

Prompt:

Using the following updated project scope @step01_scope.txt   as input, create or update a @step02_module.txt  file that serves as a comprehensive, detailed blueprint of the codebase. It should include:

Hierarchical Structure:

Detailed folder hierarchy with folder names.
File names within each folder.
Module Details:

Module names and descriptions.
For each module, list the necessary classes, functions, methods, interfaces, and other relevant code elements.
Specify language-specific features, including generics, templates, and design patterns to be used.
Include "do's and don'ts" for implementation, highlighting best practices and pitfalls to avoid.
Implementation Status:

Use checkmarks to indicate the status of each component:
‚úÖ Done
‚ùå Missing
‚ö†Ô∏è Extra (not required)
üõë Wrong or needs correction
Dependencies and Relationships:

Detail dependencies between modules and files.
Specify interfaces between components and how they interact.
Terminal Commands for Codebase Management:

Provide terminal commands for gracefully removing or moving unneeded components from the codebase.
Ensure that any removal or modification reutilizes existing work to prevent loss of effort.
Update Mechanism:

Include sections for both creation and updating of the module.txt, so it can be maintained as the codebase evolves.
Highlight changes from the previous version, indicating additions, modifications, or deletions.
Additional Guidelines:

Exclude actual code implementations; focus on providing a detailed plan that is one level above the actual code.
Ensure the output is suitable for an LLM to understand and implement the codebase.
Make the @step02_module.txt  a living document that can be updated incrementally.

**Prompt:**

*Using the following project scope and the existing `module.txt` file as a starting point, proceed to **update the entire codebase step by step** in the order you see fit. Your task includes:*

1. **Codebase Update Steps:**

   - *Break down the codebase update into sequential steps.*
   - *At each step, describe the specific changes to be made, including:*
     - *Adding new files, folders, modules, classes, functions, or other code elements.*
     - *Modifying existing components.*
     - *Removing or refactoring unnecessary components, ensuring reutilization of existing work where possible.*

2. **`module.txt` Updates:**

   - *At each step, update the `module.txt` file to reflect the current state of the codebase.*
   - *Include:*
     - *Folder hierarchy with folder names.*
     - *File names within each folder.*
     - *Module names and descriptions.*
     - *Details of classes, functions, methods, interfaces, and other code elements.*
     - *Status indicators using checkmarks:*
       - ‚úÖ *Done*
       - ‚ùå *Missing*
       - ‚ö†Ô∏è *Extra (not required)*
       - üõë *Wrong or needs correction*
     - *Dependencies between modules and files.*
     - *"Do's and don'ts" for implementation, highlighting best practices and potential pitfalls.*

3. **Terminal Commands:**

   - *Include the terminal commands (bash) needed to ascertain the current state of the codebase at each step.*
     - *Commands to check the file structure (e.g., `tree`, `ls -R`).*
     - *Commands to check git status (e.g., `git status`, `git log`).*
     - *Commands to build or run parts of the codebase (e.g., `gradle build`, `cargo build`, `npm start`).*
     - *Commands to manage or clean the codebase (e.g., `rm`, `mv`, `git rm`).*

4. **Guidelines:**

   - *Ensure that all updates align with the project scope and technical requirements.*
   - *Reutilize existing work to prevent loss of effort.*
   - *Avoid including actual code implementations; focus on the structural and organizational aspects.*
   - *Make the `module.txt` a living document that can be maintained as the codebase evolves.*



---

**Expected Output:**

*The LLM should produce:*

- *A step-by-step plan to update the codebase.*
- *At each step:*
  - *A description of the codebase changes.*
  - *An updated `module.txt` reflecting the current state.*
  - *Terminal commands to ascertain the current state in bash.*
- *An organized and clear output suitable for implementation.*

====
Please improve this prompt in context of our improved scope file like this - take this as an exampe use your 300 IQ intelligence to make the LLM prompt more comprehensive, detailed and effective - basically all types of things that is just 1 level above codebase - all language features, dos donts - so that we can keep updating this map of Codebase at every step of updation of code base

so the prompt should be about creation as well as updation
- it should also mention with checkmarks what is done, what is missing, what is extra, what is wrong,
- it should also mention terminal commands for gracefully removing or moving what is not required from the codebase while making sure everything we did is reutilized so our hardwork is not lost
