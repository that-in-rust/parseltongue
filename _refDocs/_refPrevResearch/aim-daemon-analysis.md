## Part 1: Minto Pyramid Principle Summary

### Essence (Top Level)
**AIM Daemon is a real-time, deterministic codebase intelligence system that maintains a compressed in-memory graph of code architecture, enabling sub-millisecond queries for both developers and LLMs while eliminating probabilistic hallucinations.**

### Layer 1: Core Components (Architecture)
1. **File System Watcher**: Real-time monitoring with <1ms latency using OS-native APIs (inotify/kqueue)
2. **In-Memory Graph**: Compressed graph structure with O(1) lookups via SigHash indexing
3. **SQLite Database**: Persistent storage with WAL mode for crash recovery and complex queries
4. **Query Server**: HTTP/gRPC API with <500μs response times for architectural queries
5. **Update Queue**: Decoupled event processing preventing blocking during heavy parsing

### Layer 2: Implementation Details (Data & Flow)
1. **Graph Schema**: 7 node types (File, Module, Struct, Trait, Function, Impl, Type) + 9 relationship types
2. **SigHash System**: 64-bit deterministic hashing for O(1) node/edge lookup
3. **Real-time Pipeline**: 3-12ms total latency from file save to query-ready state
4. **Compression**: 100k LOC codebase → 15-25MB in-memory representation
5. **Multi-language Support**: Pluggable parser architecture via trait system

### Layer 3: Technical Specifications (Performance & Features)
1. **Latency Targets**: File save→watcher (<1ms), AST parse (2-6ms), graph update (1-3ms), SQLite sync (1-2ms)
2. **Query Performance**: Sub-100μs for in-memory lookups, <200μs for indexed SQL queries
3. **Advanced Queries**: blast-radius analysis, cycle detection, implementation discovery
4. **LLM Integration**: Context compression (200-token summaries), constraint-aware prompts
5. **Multi-source Architecture**: Git repos, code dumps, documentation sites, live filesystems

### Layer 4: Implementation Details (Code Structure)
1. **Data Structures**: DashMap for concurrent access, FxHasher for performance, Arc/Mutex for thread safety
2. **SQLite Schema**: WAL mode, optimized indexes, prepared statements for sub-ms operations
3. **File Watching**: notify crate with recursive monitoring, bounded channels for event processing
4. **Parsing Strategy**: Tree-sitter integration, incremental parsing, content-based caching
5. **Concurrency Model**: Parallel file processing, atomic graph updates, background database sync

### Layer 5: Architectural Patterns (Design Decisions)
1. **Graph Compression**: SigHash-based deduplication, metadata as binary blobs, edge normalization
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, retry mechanisms, comprehensive logging
3. **Memory Management**: Lock-free data structures where possible, memory-mapped files for large datasets
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for language parsers, configurable conflict resolution
5. **Performance Optimization**: SIMD operations, cache-friendly data layouts, batch processing
