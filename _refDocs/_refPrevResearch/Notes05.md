# AIM Daemon Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AIM Daemon is a high-performance, real-time codebase intelligence system that maintains a compressed, deterministic graph representation of code architecture. It enables sub-millisecond queries for both developers and LLMs while eliminating probabilistic hallucinations through exact architectural relationships.

The system transforms traditional text-based code analysis into deterministic graph navigation, providing 100% accurate dependency mapping and architectural constraint enforcement. Unlike probabilistic methods that suffer from context window limitations and hallucinations, AIM Daemon uses cryptographic signature hashing and exact relationship tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time File System Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect and process code changes in real-time, so that the architectural graph remains current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is saved in the monitored codebase THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 1 millisecond
2. WHEN multiple files are modified simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue and process events without blocking
3. WHEN the file system watcher encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue monitoring other files
4. WHEN a file is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated nodes and edges from the graph within 5 milliseconds
5. WHEN a new file is created THEN the system SHALL parse and integrate it into the graph within 12 milliseconds

### Requirement 2: In-Memory Graph Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a compressed, deterministic graph representation of the codebase, so that I can perform sub-millisecond architectural queries.

5. WHEN adding new language support THEN the system SHALL use a pluggable parser architecture via trait implementation

### Requirement 5: Sub-Millisecond Query Performance

**User Story:** As a developer or LLM, I want to query architectural relationships instantly, so that I can make rapid decisions without waiting for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying "what implements trait X" THEN the system SHALL return results in under 100 microseconds
2. WHEN performing blast-radius analysis THEN the system SHALL traverse up to 5 hops in under 1 millisecond
3. WHEN detecting circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL complete analysis in under 10 milliseconds for graphs with 10k nodes
4. WHEN the query cache is warm THEN the system SHALL return cached results in under 50 microseconds
5. WHEN performing complex SQL queries THEN the system SHALL leverage prepared statements and indexes for sub-millisecond performance

### Requirement 6: HTTP/gRPC Query Server

**User Story:** As a tool developer, I want to access the architectural graph through a standard API, so that I can integrate AIM Daemon with IDEs, CI/CD systems, and other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the query server starts THEN it SHALL bind to a configurable port (default 8080) within 1 second
2. WHEN receiving HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL respond with JSON-formatted results
3. WHEN receiving gRPC requests THEN the system SHALL respond with binary-encoded results for performance
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL support at least 1000 concurrent connections
5. WHEN a query fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 7: Incremental Update Processing

**User Story:** As a developer making frequent code changes, I want the system to update the architectural graph incrementally, so that I don't experience delays during active development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is modified THEN the system SHALL complete incremental update within 12 milliseconds total
2. WHEN parsing the AST THEN the system SHALL complete parsing within 6 milliseconds for typical files (500 lines)
3. WHEN updating the graph THEN the system SHALL remove old nodes/edges and insert new ones atomically within 3 milliseconds
4. WHEN syncing to database THEN the system SHALL complete the transaction within 2 milliseconds
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other pending updates

### Requirement 8: Advanced Architectural Queries

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to perform sophisticated analysis of code relationships, so that I can enforce architectural constraints and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing blast-radius analysis THEN the system SHALL identify all nodes affected by changes to a target node
2. WHEN detecting cycles THEN the system SHALL use Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components
3. WHEN querying implementations THEN the system SHALL find all structs/classes implementing a given trait/interface
4. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify module-level dependency relationships
5. WHEN checking constraints THEN the system SHALL validate architectural rules (e.g., "no service calls DAO directly")

### Requirement 9: LLM Integration and Context Generation

**User Story:** As an LLM system, I want structured, compressed architectural context instead of raw code, so that I can generate more accurate and architecturally-compliant code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN context is requested THEN the system SHALL respond within 50 milliseconds for focused queries

### Requirement 10: Multi-Source Architecture Support

### Requirement 11: Command Line Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive CLI tool to interact with the AIM Daemon, so that I can perform extractions, queries, and analysis from the command line.

2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before logging failure
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and cache cleanup
