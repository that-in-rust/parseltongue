Router::new
Router::route
Router::nest
Handler::call
Service::call
Extract::from_request
Response::into_response
IntoResponse::into_response
FromRequest::from_request
MethodRouter::get
MethodRouter::post
MethodRouter::put
MethodRouter::delete
Layer::layer
Middleware::call
State::from_request
Path::from_request
Query::from_request
Json::from_request
Form::from_request
```

**Analysis**: Clear functional API with consistent naming patterns. Router and Handler are central entities.

```bash
$ parseltongue_20250924231324 list-entities --type structs --limit 15
Router
MethodRouter
Handler
Service
Request
Response
State
Path
Query
Json
Form
Extension
Layer
Middleware
Error
```

**Analysis**: Well-structured data models following HTTP/web patterns. Clear separation between routing, handling, and data extraction.

### Phase 3: Architectural Pattern Analysis (6-9 minutes)

```bash
$ parseltongue_20250924231324 blast-radius Router
IMPACT ANALYSIS for Router:
Risk Level: HIGH (47 impacts)

CALLS relationships:
- MethodRouter::merge (src/routing/method_routing.rs:156)
- Route::new (src/routing/route.rs:89)
- Service::call (src/service_ext.rs:45)
- Layer::layer (src/routing/router.rs:234)
- Handler::into_service (src/handler/mod.rs:67)

USES relationships:
- State management (src/extract/state.rs:23)
- Error handling (src/error_handling.rs:78)
- Middleware integration (src/middleware/mod.rs:34)
- Request processing (src/request.rs:45)

IMPLEMENTS relationships:
- Service trait (src/service_ext.rs:12)
- Clone trait (src/routing/router.rs:45)
```

**Key Architectural Insights:**
1. **Router is a central hub** (47 impacts = HIGH risk for changes)
2. **Service pattern implementation** - Router implements Service trait
3. **Middleware integration** - Clear middleware pipeline architecture
4. **State management** - Integrated state extraction and management
