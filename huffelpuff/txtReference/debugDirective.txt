======== DIRECTIVE FOR REQUIREMENT =========

Most important objective:
- write simple bug free Rust idiomatic code which is written in modules but all placed in main.rs
- use minimal experimental libraries, use mature libraries researching the web for their documentation to avoid mistakes
- write working code first, optimality will be in next version
- use databases to do operations where you can, so that RAM is not an issue
- log everything you observe while writing code or from terminal responses in /home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/parseltongue/huffelpuff/txtReference/largeLog.txt
- log every new idea which will not be included in /home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/parseltongue/huffelpuff/txtReference/approach1.txt in /home/amuldotexe/Desktop/GitHub202410/parseltongue/huffelpuff/txtReference/backlog.txt


For above requirement:
please expand in 3 lines what you understand and rehasht in 2 lines 
- then Use @web to ensure what you are solving has some precednece or documentation
- then explain what you understood in 3 lines
- then say what you will change in @main.rs
- then say what you will change in @Cargo.toml
- then check the code of @main.rs against @avoidRustBugs.txt
