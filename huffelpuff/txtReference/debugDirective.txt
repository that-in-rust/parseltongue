Most important objective:
- write simple bug free Rust idiomatic code which is written in modules but all placed in main.rs
- use minimal experimental libraries, use mature libraries researching the web for their documentation to avoid mistakes
- write working code first, optimality will be in next version
- use databases to do operations where you can, so that RAM is not an issue
- log everything you observe while writing code or from terminal responses in txtReference/largeLog.txt
- log every new idea which will not be included in txtReference/approach1.txt in txtReference/backlog.txt


Steps to Follow

- for first warning or error or requirement, rehash it in 2 lines
- then Use @web to ensure what you are solving has some precednece or documentation
- then explain what you understood in 3 lines
- then say what you will change in src/main.rs
- then say what you will change in Cargo.toml
- then check what you are saying against txtReference/avoidRustBugs.txt
- then change what you wanted to change in src/main.rs or Cargo.toml
- then make the change and write a unit test for it in src/main.rs
- then move to next warning or error or requirement
- repeat
