> ultrathink you know I want to create an agent for this project parseltongue as per @.prdArchDocs/P00.md -- can you do a @agent-general-purpose research and a research into @.doNotCommit/.refGithubRepo/claude-code/ via @agent-Explore to create a good document in

⏺ I'll research agent creation patterns and explore the Claude Code reference repository to help create a comprehensive domain document for the parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator agent.

⏺ Excellent! Both research agents have completed their work. Let me synthesize their findings into a comprehensive domain document for the parseltongue project.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The parallel research revealed a critical architectural pattern: hook-orchestrated agents use PostToolUse hooks to create deterministic pipeline sequencing. This is superior to having the agent track state internally, as hooks provide an external "traffic
  controller" that can block/redirect execution based on tool outputs.

     # D12: Hook-Orchestrated Agent Architecture Synthesis
     **Purpose**: Synthesize research on Claude Code agent patterns to design the `parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator` agent with hook-based pipeline control.
     **Research Sources**:
     - Anthropic official documentation on agents, hooks, and multi-agent systems
     - Claude Code reference repository (examples, plugins, documentation)
     - Community best practices (wshobson/agents, VoltAgent, vanzan01)
     - Anthropic Research: Multi-Agent Research System whitepaper

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive domain document that synthesizes both research efforts.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Key Discovery: The hook-orchestrated pattern is fundamentally different from traditional agent architectures. Instead of the agent tracking state internally, hooks act as external traffic controllers that block execution after each tool, providing deterministic
  pipeline sequencing. This creates a clean separation: the agent focuses on reasoning, while hooks enforce workflow constraints.

  Implementation Pattern:
  - Agent (Opus) = Strategic orchestrator with phase knowledge
  - Hooks (Python) = Tactical enforcers with exit code 2 blocking
  - State (.json) = External source of truth, not in agent memory
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  What Was Created

  Primary Document: .domainDocs/D12-agent-architecture-synthesis.md (44KB)

  This comprehensive document includes:

  1. Architecture Principles - Orchestrator-worker pattern, progressive disclosure, hook-based control
  2. Agent File Format - YAML front matter, tool scoping, model selection (Opus for orchestration)
  3. Multi-Tool Orchestration - Sequential coordination, validation routing, confidence gating
  4. Hook Implementations - Full Python code for pipeline-orchestrator.py and tool-state-tracker.py
  5. Agent Prompt Template - Complete ready-to-use .claude/agents/parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator.md
  6. Testing & Debugging - Checklists, common issues, manual testing procedures
  7. Phase Workflows - Detailed Phase 1-5 with steps, success criteria, recovery strategies
  8. Example Session - Full transcript from bug report to git commit

  Research Findings Summary

  From General-Purpose Agent (Anthropic + Community Research):
  - Orchestrator-worker pattern yields 90.2% performance improvement
  - Agents use ~4× more tokens than chat (justified for complex tasks)
  - PostToolUse hooks enable external pipeline control with blocking
  - Confidence-based gating is critical (≥80% threshold standard)
  - Test-driven agent design creates "clear target to iterate against"

  From Explore Agent (Claude Code Reference Repository):
  - 6 critical patterns: confidence filtering, hook-based control, specialized agents, multi-phase workflows, session state, graceful degradation
  - 5 ready-to-adapt templates extracted from reference examples
  - Hook configuration uses matchers like "Bash(parseltongue-*)" for tool-specific control
  - Exit code 2 with stderr = block Claude and provide feedback
  - Progressive disclosure minimizes context bloat (metadata → instructions → resources)

  Next Actions

  Ready to Implement (Critical Path ~4 hours):

  1. Create agent file: Copy template from D12 section 7 to .claude/agents/parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator.md
  2. Create hooks: Copy implementations from D12 section 4.2 and 4.3 to .claude/hooks/
  3. Update settings: Merge hook configuration from D12 section 4.4 into .claude/settings.local.json
  4. Test manually: Run echo '{}' | .claude/hooks/pipeline-orchestrator.py to verify
  5. Test end-to-end: Invoke @parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator with a test bug

  The document is self-contained with all code, examples, and guidance needed for implementation. No additional research required! 🎯

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Documentation Evolution: This commit marks a pivotal transition from multiple PRD versions (P00-P06) to a consolidated approach, while simultaneously establishing the agent architecture foundation. The D12 document now serves as the single source of truth for
  implementing the parseltongue-reasoning-orchestrator, with ready-to-use templates that can be copied directly into .claude/agents/ and .claude/hooks/.

  Next Step: The critical path is now clear - implement the agent and hooks (~4 hours) to connect the 6 functional tools into a cohesive bug-fixing pipeline.

  Your repository is now clean and up-to-date with comprehensive agent architecture documentation ready for implementation! 🚀
