# Future evolution
- dobby-subagent-code-summarizer which will be able to add summaries to cozoDB database of code with subagents
- rataTUI based claude-code which is OSS and accommodates all openAI format keys + anthropic keys + local LLMs
- rust based graph-based-code-editor because current codebases are built like pyramids, but actually are working as graphs, so why not do WYSIWYG in coding
