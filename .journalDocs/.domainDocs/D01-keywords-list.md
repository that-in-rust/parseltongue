### 6. CLI and Tool Integration Patterns

#### 6.1 Command-Line Interface Design
**Project:** Tree-Sitter CLI (`tree-sitter/crates/cli/src/`)
**Files:** Multiple CLI modules showing structured design

**Project/Component Overview:**
Tree-sitter's CLI demonstrates robust command-line interface design with structured configuration, error handling, progress reporting, and testing integration.

**Implementation Details:**
```rust
// Structured CLI configuration
#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
#[command(propagate_version = true)]
struct CliArgs {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Commands,
    
    #[arg(short, long, help = "Enable verbose output")]
    verbose: bool,
    
    #[arg(short, long, help = "Quiet mode - minimal output")]
    quiet: bool,
    
    #[arg(long, help = "Configuration file path")]
    config: Option<PathBuf>,
}

#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Commands {
    Parse {
        #[arg(help = "Input file to parse")]
        input: PathBuf,
        
        #[arg(long, help = "Output format")]
        format: OutputFormat,
    },
    
    Query {
        #[arg(help = "Query file to execute")]
        query: PathBuf,
        
        #[arg(help = "Source files to analyze")]
        sources: Vec<PathBuf>,
    },
    
    Test {
        #[arg(long, help = "Test directory")]
        test_dir: PathBuf,
        
        #[arg(long, help = "Parallel test execution")]
        parallel: bool,
    },
}

// Progress reporting and user feedback
pub struct ProgressReporter {
    pub enabled: bool,
    current_step: usize,
    total_steps: usize,
    start_time: Instant,
}

impl ProgressReporter {
    pub fn new(total_steps: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            enabled: !std::env::var("QUIET").is_ok(),
            current_step: 0,
            total_steps,
            start_time: Instant::now(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn step(&mut self, description: &str) {
        if !self.enabled {
            return;
        }
        
        let progress = (self.current_step as f64 / self.total_steps as f64) * 100.0;
        let elapsed = self.start_time.elapsed();
        let estimated = (elapsed / (self.current_step + 1) as u32) * (self.total_steps as u32);
        
        eprintln!("[{progress:.1}%] {} (elapsed: {:.2}s, eta: {:.2}s)", 
                 description, elapsed.as_secs_f32(), estimated.as_secs_f32());
        
        self.current_step += 1;
    }
}
```
