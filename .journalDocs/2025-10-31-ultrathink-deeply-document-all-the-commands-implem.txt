  📦 What Was Pushed

  New Documentation in .prdArchDocs/:
  1. C01-commands-20251031.md (29KB) - Comprehensive CLI reference
  2. C01-COMMANDS-INDEX.md (3.6KB) - Quick lookup guide
  3. P00.md - Project context document
  4. ProductStrategy01.md - Product strategy documentation

  Branch: ultrathink → origin/ultrathinkRepository: https://github.com/that-in-rust/parseltongue.git

  The documentation now provides developers with complete command-line reference for all 6 tools in the Parseltongue pipeline, including usage examples, error handling, and performance
  targets.

> Hey, can you just check if we follow the same capability of connection between multiple interfaces such that I can find which function is dependent on which functions directly by a 
single command from COSODb. Can you do that? We did that in interface_signature graphs in our previous code  @parseltongue*.txt ultrathink

⏺ I'll investigate whether the current implementation tracks function-to-function dependencies like the previous interface_signature graph system. Let me use the Plan agent to
  thoroughly research this.

⏺ Plan(Research dependency tracking capabilities)
  ⎿  Done (33 tool uses · 79.0k tokens · 5m 56s)                                                                                                                                        

⏺ 📊 Research Complete: Dependency Tracking Investigation

  Based on the comprehensive investigation, I have critical findings to report:

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The Answer is NO - Current system CANNOT track function dependencies
  - Previous ISG implementation had full call graph (<50μs queries)
  - Current CozoDB schema stores nodes but NO edges/relationships
  - This is a critical gap vs PRD requirements for "hopping/blast-radius"
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  🔍 Key Findings Summary

  ❌ What You CANNOT Do Now (But Could Before)

  Impossible Queries in Current System:
  # ❌ "Which functions does calculate_sum call?"
  # ❌ "Which functions call database_connect?"
  # ❌ "What's the blast radius of changing UserStruct?"
  # ❌ "What's the execution path from main to process_data?"

  Previous System Could Do (from archive):
  // ✅ get_called_functions(hash)     -> <50μs
  // ✅ find_callers(hash)              -> <50μs  
  // ✅ calculate_blast_radius(hash)    -> <1ms
  // ✅ get_execution_path(from, to)    -> <100μs

  📋 What's Missing

  1. No Edge Collection - Tool 1 doesn't extract function calls from AST
  2. No Relationship Storage - CozoDB schema has no DependencyEdges table
  3. No Graph Queries - Tool 3 can't traverse dependencies
  4. PRD Gap - Explicit requirements for hopping/blast-radius are unmet

  🏗️ Previous Architecture (Lost)

  The archived implementation had:
  StableDiGraph<NodeData, EdgeKind>

  EdgeKind {
      Calls,        // Function A calls B
      Implements,   // Struct implements Trait  
      Uses,         // Entity uses another
  }

  With dedicated call_graph.rs visitor extracting calls during tree-sitter parsing.
