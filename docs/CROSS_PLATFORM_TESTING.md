  - Validates SigHash consistency across platforms
  - Ensures FxHasher produces identical results
  - Tests Fully Qualified Name (FQN) generation consistency

## Test Architecture

### 1. Integration Tests (`tests/cross_platform_integration.rs`)

Comprehensive integration tests that validate core cross-platform functionality:

#### Test Categories

- **SigHash Determinism**: Validates that identical signatures produce identical hashes across multiple iterations
- **Cross-Platform Hash Consistency**: Tests hash consistency for known signature patterns
- **Graph Structure Determinism**: Ensures identical graph structures are created from the same input
- **Serialization Consistency**: Validates JSON serialization/deserialization roundtrips
- **Platform Isolation**: Tests that platform-specific paths don't affect signature hashing
- **Performance Consistency**: Validates consistent query performance across platforms

#### Key Test Functions

```rust
#[test]
fn test_sighash_determinism()
#[test] 
fn test_cross_platform_hash_consistency()

#### Test Signatures Covered

- Basic functions: `fn main()`, `fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32`
- Generic functions: `fn identity<T>(value: T) -> T`
- Complex structs: `struct User { name: String, age: u32 }`
- Traits: `trait Display { fn fmt(&self) -> String; }`
- Lifetimes: `fn with_lifetime<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str`
- Module paths: `std::collections::HashMap::new`
- Unicode: `fn test_unicode_函数() -> String`

### 3. Cross-Platform Test Runner (`tests/cross_platform_runner.rs`)

Comprehensive test runner that provides detailed metrics and reporting:

#### Capabilities

- **Platform Information Collection**: OS, architecture, Rust version detection

  with:
    name: cross-platform-reports-${{ matrix.os }}
    path: target/cross_platform_reports/
```

## Key Validation Points

### 1. SigHash Consistency

- **Deterministic Hashing**: FxHasher produces identical results for identical inputs
- **Platform Independence**: Hash values are identical across Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Iteration Consistency**: Multiple hash generations produce identical results
- **Unicode Support**: Proper handling of Unicode characters in signatures

### 2. Graph Structure Consistency

- **Node Creation**: Identical nodes created from same signatures
- **Edge Relationships**: Consistent relationship extraction
- **Query Results**: Identical query results across platforms
- **Serialization**: Consistent JSON serialization/deserialization

### 3. Performance Consistency

- **Query Performance**: Sub-millisecond query times maintained across platforms
- **Hash Generation**: Consistent hash generation performance
- **Memory Usage**: Predictable memory consumption patterns
- **Variance Tolerance**: Acceptable performance variance within defined bounds

## Test Data

### Reference Signatures

The test suite includes comprehensive signature patterns:

```rust
// Basic patterns
"fn main()"
"struct User { name: String, age: u32 }"
"trait Display { fn fmt(&self) -> String; }"

// Complex patterns
"fn generic<T, U>(a: T, b: U) -> (T, U)"
"fn with_lifetime<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str"
"std::collections::HashMap::new"

// Unicode patterns
"fn test_unicode_函数() -> String"
```

### Expected Behavior

All test signatures must produce:
- Identical hash values across platforms
- Consistent graph structures
- Deterministic query results
- Stable serialization formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Hash Inconsistency**: Usually indicates FxHasher implementation differences
2. **Performance Variance**: May indicate system load or timing precision issues
3. **Serialization Differences**: Could indicate JSON ordering or precision issues
4. **Graph Structure Differences**: May indicate parsing or relationship extraction issues

### Debugging

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test cross_platform
```

Check individual test reports:
```bash
ls target/cross_platform_reports/
cat target/cross_platform_reports/cross_platform_summary_*.json
```

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### Linux
- Standard reference platform
- Most stable performance characteristics
- Used for baseline measurements

#### macOS
- May have different timing characteristics
- File system case sensitivity differences
- Memory management variations

#### Windows
- Path separator differences (handled in tests)
- Different default precision for timing
- Potential Unicode handling differences

## Validation Criteria

### Success Criteria

- **100% Hash Consistency**: All signatures produce identical hashes
- **Deterministic Graph Structure**: Identical graphs from same input
- **Performance Within Bounds**: Query times under 1ms, variance under 500%
- **Serialization Stability**: Consistent JSON roundtrips

### Failure Conditions
