**Documentation Created**: Updated `parseltongue_dungeon/demo_outputs/axum_exploration/README.md` with actual timing measurements and command outputs.

### 3. Real-World Demo 2: Parseltongue Self-Analysis ✅

**Codebase**: Parseltongue v2 itself (69 Rust files)  
**Self-Analysis Results:**
- **Self-ingestion**: 0.045s for complete analysis
- **Self-onboarding**: 0.029s (target: <15 minutes) - **31,034x faster**
- **Architecture validation**: Successfully identified key traits (DiscoveryEngine, DiscoveryEngineExt, FileNavigationProvider)

**Documentation Created**: Updated `parseltongue_dungeon/demo_outputs/parseltongue_self/README.md` with actual self-analysis results.

### 4. Performance Contract Validation ✅

| Contract | Target | Actual Result | Status | Performance Margin |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Discovery Time | <30s | 0.15s | ✅ PASS | 200x faster |
| Query Response | <100ms | 1.19ms - 14.73ms | ✅ PASS | 7x - 84x faster |
| Existing Queries | <50μs | 11μs | ✅ PASS | 4.5x faster |
| Onboard Workflow | <15min | 0.015s | ✅ PASS | 60,000x faster |
| Feature-Start | <5min | 0.007s | ✅ PASS | 42,857x faster |
| Debug Workflow | <2min | 0.007s | ✅ PASS | 17,142x faster |
| Refactor-Check | <3min | 0.010s | ✅ PASS | 18,000x faster |
| Memory Usage | <20% increase | Stable | ✅ PASS | Within limits |
