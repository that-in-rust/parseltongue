# ISG Export Examples

This folder contains working example diagrams generated by Parseltongue's export functionality.

## Files

- `simple-example.md` - Simple Mermaid example (small codebase, works perfectly, < 1ms generation)
- `README.md` - This documentation

## What Works

Parseltongue successfully generates diagrams for small to medium codebases. Large codebases like Tokio (2,500+ nodes) cause browser rendering issues.

## Status

The large-scale Tokio examples have been removed because:
- Single diagrams with 2,500+ nodes crash browsers
- GitHub Mermaid rendering has node limits
- HTML files require manual download and viewing
- User experience was poor with massive diagrams

## Recommended Usage

For small codebases (< 500 nodes):
```bash
parseltongue export mermaid --output my-architecture.md
parseltongue export html --output my-architecture.html
```

For large codebases (500+ nodes):
- Use the CLI queries directly: `parseltongue query what-implements TraitName`
- Use hierarchical exports when available in future versions
- Focus on specific modules rather than entire codebase

## Performance Notes

- Small diagrams (< 100 nodes): Render perfectly in GitHub and browsers
- Medium diagrams (100-500 nodes): Generally work well
- Large diagrams (500+ nodes): May cause performance issues
- CLI queries work excellent regardless of codebase size
